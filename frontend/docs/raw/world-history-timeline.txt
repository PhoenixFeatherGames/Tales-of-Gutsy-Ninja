*This is the history of this world so far
Keep in mind, its an alternate universe/timeline from the cannon naruto, so some things happen differently, some cannon character names are changed, and this list includes some OC's, this timeline will be a living document and subject to change. Also keep in mind, in this game, once made, 1 real life month is 3 in game months, so 4 irl months equals 1 year in game, and is an entire season like spring, summer, fall, winter.

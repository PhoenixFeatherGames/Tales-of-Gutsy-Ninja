[Bcu][|] Kaguya [|]
[Bc]The Kaguya is a clan known for their savage battle tactics and archaic values. The clan is noted for being very savage and battle-hungry, having no tactics when entering battle that they initiated simply to show off their ferocity. It was due to this attempt to prove themselves that the entire clan was almost killed off when attacking Kirigakure on there own, however, it was also due to this that Kiri initiated their clan into the village.

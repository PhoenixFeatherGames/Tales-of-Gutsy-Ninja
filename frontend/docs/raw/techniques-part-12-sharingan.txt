[Bc]Description:
[C]The Sharingan, Literally meaning: Mirror Wheel Eye, is the dōjutsu kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan that appears selectively among its members. When a wielder of this kekkei genkai experiences a powerful emotional condition with regards to a person precious to them, their brain releases a special form of chakra that affects the optic nerves, transforming the eyes into Sharingan; for that reason the Sharingan is described as an "eye that reflects the heart". Often, as per the Uchiha's so-called "Curse of Hatred", this emotion is a negative one, brought on by stress or loss The emotion may also be positive, driven by a desire to protect or reunite with a loved one, but the emotion must be traumatically strong. One of the Sharingan is known as the "Eye of Insight", where as the other is refered to as the "Eye of Hypnotism", however, this may be a misnomer as the abilities of either may be used interchangeably, excluding their final stage which would be the only way to truly tell the difference. 

[C]That said, having only a single sharingan halves it's ocular abilities. Unlike other dōjutsu, the Sharingan evolves into stages of increasing power and effect, each phase requiring a special trigger, and potential. Even though this Dojūtsu is considered a C-Rank KKG, each stage is progressively stronger, and more straining, requiring the mind and body of the weilder to be strong enough to evolve, needing the prerequisites of higher ranks potential to unlock. These eyes also birth unique techniques, not requiring the purchase there of, however, to understand how to use said techniques, there must be the necessary room in the Jutsu Bank and the proper potential.

[UB]Single Tomoe:
[U]D-Rank
[C]The 1st Tomoe of the sharingan awakens when the user has suffered the feeling of true betrayal, heartbreak, desperation, or denial. This stage drains -2ChP/Minute activated per eye activated. 
[C]The "Eye of Insight" allows the user to analyze even the slightest of movements, including reading lips. This even allows the user to closely observe Taijutsu, Bukijutsu, and Kenjutsu, (that aren't clan locked), and replicate them, if physically able, after witnessing it performed 5 times, adding the new technique to their Jutsu Pool. This also passively increases the user's EP, OP, and ROP by +10%. 
[C]Through the "Eye of Hypnotism", when casting Genjutsu via Sharingan with a Single Tomoe, or having genjutsu cast visually to the host through their sharingan, one uses their Sharingan score as the "Grappling Strength" +10% of there Genjutsu score. They also use their "Sharingan" and "Genjutsu" score to determine the increase in Genjutsu effects cast in this way. Upon gaining the first Tomoe, one is able to perform a special technique, known only as " [Genjutsu: Sharingan|http://aminoapps.com/p/ilz71v] ", via direct eye contact, requiring a C-Rank Jutsu Bank slot to possess, understand and use. At this stage, if the target has a 50% lower Genjutsu grappling score, you can implant suggestions in your targets mind to think or move in minor ways, effecting half their actions or reactions, making 5 word statemens or believing 5 word thoughts, increasing by +5 words per sharingan stage, while leaving them to think the thoughts were there own. Casting Genjutsu: Sharingan also lowers the target's EP, OP, and ROP by 10%, increasing by 10% per Sharingan stage!  

[UB]Double Tomoe:
[U]C-Rank
[C]The 2nd Tomoe of the sharingan awakens when the user or someone very close or dear to them is, or is truly believed to be, the target of an attack that will kill them, a deep feeling of helplessness or despair,  and the 1st tomoe has already been unlocked. This stage drains -4ChP/Minute activated per eye activated. 
[C]The "Eye of Insight" can now visably see external chakra, giving it color in order to distinguish it by its composition and source aswell, even track chakra trails left behind as old as an hour. Overall, the user may now replicate all kinds of techniques, (that are not clan locked), if capable, after witnessing them performed 4 times, adding the new techniques to their Jutsu Pool,  and passively increases the user's EP, OP, and ROP by +20%. 
[C]Through the "Eye of Hypnotism", when casting Genjutsu via Sharingan with a Double Tomoe, or having genjutsu cast visually to the host through their sharingan, one uses their Sharingan score as the "Grappling Strength" +20% of there Genjutsu score. if the target has a 50% lower Genjutsu grappling score, your genjutsu can read concious thoughts and extract truthful statements of 10 words or less, increasing by 5 words per tier. 

[UB]Triple Tomoe:
[U]B-Rank
[C]The 3rd Tomoe of the sharingan awakens only after the 1st and second have. The user must witness the death of someone dear to them, or to somehow be resuscitated from death, the feeling of truly deep loss, or of being so relatively close to death itself. This stage drains -6ChP/Minute activated per eye activated. 
[C]Their "Eye of Insight" may now visably see internal chakra even through thin obstacles, although not aswell as the Byakugan, it may track chakra trails left behind as old as a day. They now can replicate techniques, if able, after witnessing them performed 3 times and passively increases the user's EP, OP, and ROP by +30%. 
[C]Through the "Eye of Hypnotism", when casting Genjutsu via Sharingan with a Triple Tomoe, or having genjutsu cast visually to the host through their sharingan, one uses their Sharingan score as the "Grappling Strength" +30% of there Genjutsu score. Their genjutsu can see day old memories as far back as 1 month, increasing by +1 month per stage, and enter the mind scape of their target's subconcious of targets if the target has a 50% lower Genjutsu grappling score.

[UB]Mangekyō:
[U]A-Rank
[C]A Mangekyō Sharingan is distinguished from a normal Sharingan by its appearance, which changes the form of the tomoe seal. While the exact design differs for each user, though all resemble pinwheels. This may only be awakened once the three tomoe have been granted, and the user must be, or truly feel, the trauma of being responsible for a truly loved one or closest friend or family. Just being activated drains -8ChP/Minute per eye activated, but each eye also gains S-Rank abilities unique to the user with their own costs, and when used together, form the great, "[Susanoo|http://aminoapps.com/p/pkb5i5g]". Over time and repeated use, the dōjutsu cast by the Mangekyō's eyes may lead to their eye's permanent loss of vision. The castor may use their Mangekyō dōjutsu an amount of times equivalent to 10+(10% (1/10th) of their "Sharingan" score), (rounded down). Using the Susanoo adds 1 use for each eye. In practice, this means the eye of one with a "Sharingan" score of 100 will become "Blind" on it's 10th use of it's power.

[UsB]Eternal Mangekyō:
[Su]S-Rank, Kinjutsu
[Cs]The Mangekyō Sharingan may only be obtained by removing your own Mangekyō Sharingan, and replace them, transplanting the Mangekyō of a close blood relative, making it absolutely secret and forbidden in order to avoide intentional familicide. Unlike with other transplants, this second evolution will allow the user to retain their original techniques in addition to access the new eyes' respective techniques, but will never lose their sight for this. These eyes reflect both, merging the designs of the two Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan together when activated and drain -10ChP/Minute per eye activated, as well as gain the ability to aquire the Perfect Susanoo. This stage also increases the effects of the lower tiers.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Susanoo is a gigantic, humanoid avatar made of the user's chakra which surrounds them and fights on their behalf. When activated, Susanoo forms around the user and becomes an extension of their will, acting and attacking on their behalf. By default, Susanoo is anchored to its user and they to it: in its less developed forms it will move around with the user; in its more completed forms the user will be suspended within Susanoo, being brought with it as it moves around. Susanoo has several developmental stages. Each stage has it's own rank representing it's complexity to ise, filling Jutsu Bank Slots. Practiced users go through all the stages every time they manifest it, layering more advanced stages over earlier ones or stripping them away as is needed; they can choose to stop at any developmental stage. Once unlocked, add "Susanoo" to your list of Jutsu Skills. 

[UB]First Stage:
[U]C-Rank
[C]At its simplest level, users only manifest aspects of Susanoo's skeletal structure, such as a ribcage for basic defence or an arm for interacting with the surroundings. This basic structure has a DP of 100 and it's own strength score of 25, using it's castor's OP as it's own. Forming this takes 10ChP and every minute after to sustain.

[Bu]Second Stage
[U]B-Rank
[C]Above having a simple rib cage, the 3 meter (9') tall skeletal structure of an upper torso is formed, adding a neck, skull, and second arm. To evolve to this stage, the castor must have a "Susanoo" score of 25. The Susanoo now has a Strength score of 50, and it's DP in this stage has increased to 200. Forming this takes 15ChP and every following minute to sustain.

[Bu]Third Stage
[U]B-Rank
[C]Susanoo now has "sinew" and "flesh", this torso, sitting 5m (15') high... To evolve to this point, the castor must have a "Susanoo" score of 50. These extra layers have raised it's DP to 300, and these muscles have raised it's strength 75. Forming this takes 20ChP and every minute to sustain.

[Bu]Fourth Stage
[U]A-Rank
[C]The now 10m (30') Susanoo is coated in a unique set of armor, it's DP now 400 with a stength score of 100. By this stage, it has also gained a  spiritual weapon or unique to it's castor equivalent to a first tier S-Rank Technique. This ability  To evolve to this point, the castor's "Susanoo" score must reach 60. Forming this takes 25ChP every continuous minute to sustain.

[Bu]Full Susanoo 
[U]S-Rank
[C]Now in it's fifth,  and quite legendary stage, this Susanoo literally stands 20m (60') tall, walking on two legs as its castor is suspended above the ground within it's core! Their unique spiritual weapon is now the equivalent of a fifth tier S-Rank Technique. To evolve to this form, one's "Susanoo" score must be 100. This form has 500 DP, 150 Strength, and can move at twice the land speed of it's castor. Forming this takes 30ChP and every minute to sustain.

[Bus]Perfect Susanoo 
[Us]S-Rank, Kinjutsu
[Cs]The absolute, true, full form of the Susanoo that's on par with even the likes of the Tailed Beasts... This heavenly state can only be evolved with the power of the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan and the Full Susanoo! This diety like state stands at 50m (150') tall, it's castor suspended by a protective crystal in its forehead. It's DP is worth 1000, and it's strength is equivalent to 300. Their unique spiritual weapon is now the equivalent of a tenth tier S-Rank Technique. It can move on land and air at three times the speed of it's castor with it's giant legs and wings that protrude from it's back. Forming and sustaining this costs 30ChP every minute active.

Cost:
 
Cost of reversed Genjutsu +1 Tier
 
Description:
 
 When a genjutsu is used on them, the user quickly decrypts the genjutsu with their Sharingan to understand how it works, allowing them to reverse the active Genjutsu onto their attacker, causing a "Genjutsu Reversal",  if the user is able to break a Genjutsu cast onto them, similar to reversing the dominant and submissive roles of a grapple.

The cost of this jutsu is almost entirely dependent on the Genjutsu cast, costing +1Tier higher than the Genjutsu being reversed. Unlike other many other jutsu, the effect of this technique cannot be increased UNLESS the user also personally knows how to perform the jutsu cast on them they are reversing.

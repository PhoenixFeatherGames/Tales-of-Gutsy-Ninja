[Bc]Cost:
[C]3EP per 5ChP gained
[Bc]Description:
[C]Chakra is the essence of life and is essential to even the most basic technique. Through various methods, the most common of which is hand seals, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire, or creating illusions. Chakra is ordinarily not visible to the unaided eye unless it is highly concentrated or manifested in large amounts. This is rarely seen due to the restrictions of eight specific tenketsu known as the Eight Gates, which limit the amount of chakra an individual can release at a single given time.

[C]All of that said, when ones Chakra runs out, they lose all of that versatility when it may be needed most, and in some cases, if no one chakra to lose, they could very well lose their life instead. In such cases, one may burn their energy used for Evasion Points to forcibly produce the chakra they need in times of emergency. This restores an additional +3 Chakra Points per additional -2EP burnt.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Possibly the most basic fire style ninjutsu, the user breathes out a small, dry flame. This technique is often used for anything from lighting a camp fire or a small act of arson, but otherwise,  it has little use for combat dealing only 5 Damage, and not even severe enough to cause a full tier of Burn at it's base level. Every 2 points of chakra added to this technique will increase its effect by +3 damage, +1 OP, and +1% Burn, but is still so small and near user that it uses their OP, (not ROP), if wielded offensively.

[C]Possibly the most basic wind style ninjutsu, the user forces the surrounding air to blow in a different direction. This technique is mosty used to keep yourself, and your scent, downwind, or on the contrary, blow something upwind, such as smells or powders or leaves, etc. For direct combat, this technique may not have much use other than blowing small nuisances away, having a pushing Str of 5, but possibly, if stronger than those in it's way, or if the targets are caught off guard, it will push those hit prone, but not hurt them. These winds also reduce the ROP of an incoming attack by -5. The effect of these winds reach are equal to the users ROP+5, aswell as add +5 ROP to any ranged attacks. For every +2 chakra point pushed into these winds, their Strength and distance increases by +3, and reduces incoming ROP by -3.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Possibly the most basic earth style ninjutsu, the user raises interlocking slabs of earth to form a tent like structure intended to shelter one from nature, needing to lay or crouch Prone to fit inside unless the size is increased enough to be taller than the one in it. It is not particularly helpful in a fight, having only 5DP of defense in it's base state, but good for camping overnight. If used offensively to pin or encase their target, one uses ROP to hit their mark. If pinned, the target will be grappled against a strength equal to it's DP, but not hurt, and need to struggle or break free. It's base dimensions are 6'L×3'W×3'H and about 3 inches thick. Adding incriments of +1ChP and 2ib of earth increases each dimension and ROP by +1 and the overal DP by +3.

In its base form, it can remove any impurities from up to one quart (32oz) of water, just leaving H²O. Every +1 chakra point and cup (8oz) of water  added to this can purify an extra Pint (16oz) and remove 1% more of poison.

[Bc]Element:

[BC]Prerequisite 
[C]N/A
[Bc]Cost:
[C]3 Chakra Points per Clone Per Minute
[Bc]Description:
[C]This is a basic technique that every shinobi should be able to use. For this technique, users create one or more illusory clones of themselves to visably perform simple actions but have no substance and thus are incapable of physical contact or impact. 

[C]For every clone conjured, the odds of hitting a clone instead of the castor by a threat unaware of the real shinobi's position is increased. For example, casting a single clone would create a 50% chance of attacking the clone or the real target, where as a maximum of 10 Clones would create a 9% chance of attacking the real being, and 91% chance of attacking a clone.
*If more exact positions are specified, then the user of this technique must share their real position privately to a 3rd party moderator as proof. This is true for all sorts of clones.

[C]If a clone or the user attacks, and the target is not aware of their identity, the target must assume the stats for dodging are that of the real being and decide how to counter prior to the real damage calculation's or identitie's reveal.
*Whether or not it is a clone or the player attacking must be revealed privately to a 3rd party moderator as proof. Dodging the clone, though typically costing less EP for mechanics, does not inherently give away their identity. This is true of all sorts of clones.

[C]The land speed of the clone is treated the same as the user's, but the clone must remain within R.O.P. distance to the user. A clone's EP and OP are equal to the castor's R.O.P., they do not have DP or HP. Their R.O.P., such as if throwing illusory shuriken, are equal to half of the user's ROP.

[BC]Prerequisite 
[C]Be at least of Genin Rank 
[Bc]Cost:
[C]3 Chakra Points Per Minute
[Bc]Description
[C]An academy graduate level Ninjutsu, the Transformation Technique allows the user to take the appearance of who or whatever they choose. Users will gain attributes and physical features similar to whatever they transform into, such as a weapon's sharpness or an animal's shape and size, though no smaller than half or larger than twice the user's size. 

[C]A transformation increases your stealth score by 25%, allowing one to hide in plain sight as a random passersby in a crowded street or even a bush among trees. Although this disguises the castors appearance visually and physically, and may even alter their voice, it cannot hide their scent, or manurisms, so if a dusguised individual is conversing but does not know who they may be impersinating well, or if their illusion is mishapen such as a discolored leaf or missing scar, they may easily give away their facade prematurely.

[C]If the castor decides to transform into an inanimate object or even a wild animal, they may immitate some properties, but ultimately will not become what they appear to be. They may gain the sharp property of a swords blade, or a wolves claws, but will not obtain the swords damage or durability, nor the wolves hightened senses. They may obtain properties such as size, shape, weight, and texture, but will not be granted any stats such as damage nor natural abilities such as flight or poison. Complex item properties or abilities may not be replicated UNLESSS in the possessionof the castor when they use this techniqueto become said item. This illusory disguise is forcebly dispelled if user is struck directly, runs out of Chakra, or falls unconcious.

Despite the technique's dramatic name, it is not actually harmful. The pain is fairly extreme....

[C]If one manages to pull this off, their target will be helplessly lauched up and foward by meters equal to half damage dealt and land prone!

[C]1 Evasion Point per Meter Jumped
[Cb]Description 
[C]The technique requires the user to perform a jump kick into their opponent's face. User's are commonly known to throw a weapon, such as a kunai, at the enemy to distract them while he takes advantage of their blind spot in order to land the otherwise difficult blow, or otherwise save this move for when they find stealth to be on their side.

[C]The flair of this technique makes it a bit harder to land as they soar across the field, using their jumping distance, through the air to hit their mark, using ROP instead of EP, however, the impact is surprisingly potent, as the distance in feet jumped between the user and the target is added as damage and ROP to the attack. A direct hit will knock the target Prone.

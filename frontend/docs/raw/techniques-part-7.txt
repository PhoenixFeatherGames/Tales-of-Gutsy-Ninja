[Bc]Description:
[C]The Eight Gates exist in order to limit the flow of chakra within an individual's body. Ordinarily, individuals can use no more than 20% of their body's full potential, the brain's way of protecting the individual from harming their body through overexertion. With training, individuals can learn to remove these limiters, referred to as "opening" the gates. For any gate to open, the one before it must be opened. With each opened gate, individuals are given access to more and more of their body's chakra, thus increasing their physical strength and speed each stage incrimently by +16% of the stage prior, but at the cost of their own health, or even life, for once you close the gates, your Strength, Speed, and Taijutsu will reduce by an amount equal to the boost aquired from the highest gate opened that day for 26 hours, reducing Your current HP, EP, and DP by the same amount this reduces your max HP, EP, and DP by...

Rank: C
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 20
Cost: 12ChP per minute
Desc: Located in the brain's left hemisphere, this 1st gate removes the user's mental inhibitions. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Front Lotus, a technique that tires them afterwards.

[B]The Gate of Healing (休門, Kyūmon)
Rank: C
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 30, 1st Gate Open
Cost: 15ChP per minute 
Desc: Located in the brain's right hemisphere, this 2nd gate increases the user's physical strength. This has the added effect of re-energizing the body, enabling it to rapidly recover from exhaustion, restoring your current DP, EP, and HP by 16%!

[B]The Gate of Life (生門, Seimon)
Rank: B
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 40, 2nd Gate Open
Cost: 17ChP per minute
Desc: Located on the spinal cord, this 3rd gate turns the user's skin red when opened. Other effects include the user's pupils disappearing, their hair standing on end, and bulging veins all over their body. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the "Reverse Lotus".

[B]The Gate of Pain (傷門, Shōmon)
Rank: B
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 50, 3rd Gate Open
Cost: 20ChP per minute
Desc: This 4th gate is located on the spinal cord, intensifying the previous bloodflow and physical strain. Users may open this gate as they're about to use the Reverse Lotus to increase the effect; if one performs the Reverse Lotus in this way, their muscles start to tear and their nose to start bleeding, totalling +1 tier of Bleeding all together.

[B]The Gate of Limit (杜門, Tomon)
Rank: A
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 60, 4th Gate Open
Cost: 22ChP per minute
Desc: Located in the abdomen, opening this 5th gate shows little noticable difference except increased bloodflow from the nose and pulsing, bulging veins, this severity of rupturing blood vessels increases the Tier of Bleeding by +1. If one opens this gate as they are about to deliver the final blow of the Reverse Lotus,  their limbs receive compound fractures, crippling them if hit, even if used to block.

[B]The Gate of View (景門, Keimon)
Rank: A
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 70, 5th Gate Open
Cost: 25ChP per minute
Desc: Located in the stomach, this 6th gate increases all the user's capabilities. The power that emanates from the user is enough to displace surrounding bodies of water. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the "Morning Peacock", wherein the user's punches are so fast that friction with the air produces flames. Opening this gate creates a noticable green aura around the user caused by the burning sodium chloride produced by your sweat, adding +1° of Burn as well as +1 tier of Bleed from the warmer, faster flowing blood...

[B]The Gate of Wonder (驚門, Kyōmon)
Rank: S
Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 80, 6th Gate Open
Cost: 27ChP per minute
Desc: The 7th gate, located below the stomach, causes the user's body to secrete a blueish, water heavy sweat. The sweat immediately evaporates, creating an aura around the user that can be mistaken for chakra increasing the the tier of burning and bleeding by +1°. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the "Daytime Tiger", a single punch that creates a pocket of compressed air. After opening this gate, the user's muscle fibers rupture, causing them intense pain if anyone touch him as all of their limbs become disabled.

[B]The Gate of Death (死門, Shimon)
[S]Rank: S Kinjutsu
[S]Prereq: Taijutsu Score of 100, 7th Gate Open
[S]Cost: 30ChP per minute
[S]Desc: Located at the heart, users open this 8th and final gate by puncturing their chest with their thumb in order to direct the chakra there. While open, the user's heart pumps at maximum speed, granting them power a hundred times greater than they are usually capable of, far beyond that of even Kage! A "Steam of Blood" (血の蒸気, Chi no Jōki) is emitted from the user's pores and hair, resembling a flaming red aura, Taking the user to Bleed 5 and 4°Burn without exception. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the "Evening Elephant" and "Night Guy". The eighth gate causes the body to continually heat up until it's been cooked from the inside-out, threatening to reduce the user to nothing more than ash.

*Realistically,  each gate is 5-10×stronger than the last, or exponentially grows rather than linearly, but 40×base power would break this game...

**Actually that would be Base×390,625 lol

[Bc]Description:
[C]A taijutsu breathing method developed by gathering up large amounts of oxygen to increase ones lung capacity many fold, the user is granted strength similar to the Eight Gates, even including similar physical changes to the user, but fewer drawbacks. Much like the Eight Gates, this technique has several stages or "activations" (活性, kassei). Opening a "Gate" removes a natural limiter, which as a consequence, results in significant changes to your bodily functions that improve ones physical capabilities to dangerous degrees the body may not be able to maintain unharmed,  however, instead of releasing these limiters, these "Stages" manually replicate these bodily changes directly.With each "Activation", individuals increase their physical strength and speed each stage incrimently by +14% of the prior, but at the risk of over exhaustion, for once you revert the "Stages", your Strength, Speed, and Taijutsu will reduce by an amount equal to the boost aquired from the highest "Activation" that day for 26 hours, reducing Your current HP, EP, and DP by the same amount this reduces your max HP, EP, and DP by, though not deadly, can cause the user to knock out...

[|] Poison Creation [|]

Depends on skill level, Active
 
Technique:
 
Iryojutsu
 
Element:
 
 N/A
 
Prerequisite 
 Dependant on the type of poison
 
Cost:
 
N/A
 
Description:
 
Through the practice of iryojutsu a user of this technique can learn to create varying levels of poison, each rather deadly with unique traits that can cause devastating effects on the battlefield, turning the tides of combat in the castor's favor. To create these poisons one must do so in a crafting post with the ranks of the different poisons being equivalent to the lines required with item crafting of the same rank.

D-Rank
Prerequisite: 20 Iryojutsu, 10 Intelligence
The basic poison commonly sold in most shops that are exclusive to Shinobi is the first type of poison medical Shinobi learn. When Crafted the castor will produce three vials of poison per 6 lines. This poison when introduced to the inside of a target's body will cause a tier of poison which can either be healed with certain medicine or with the proper iryojutsu technique.

C-Rank
 
Prerequisite: 60 Iryojutsu, 60 Intelligence
After properly learning how to make a basic poison in liquid form, Shinobi can then learn how to create such a thing in gas form, allowing for an easier time poisoning targets. Alongside that this poison will cause two tiers of poison and cause a sense of dizziness in a target, reducing their EP, OP, ROP, and movement speed by 20% for as long as they are affected. This poison can also be made in a liquid state as well. If one wishes to be healed by this they must be healed by poison extraction but will take 50% longer if the person healing it has a lower Iryojutsu score than the creator of the poison. It will go faster if the healer instead has double the score. If medical supplies are used it will only be able to heal the tiers of poison, the stat reduction will continue on for a minute after. This poison takes 15 lines to craft

B-Rank
Prerequisite: 100 Iryojutsu, 100 Intelligence
From here the skill required to create poisons increases rather exponentially. With this level of poison when administered to a target they will gain t3 poison, and have a 30% reduction to their movement speed, OP, EP, and ROP. On top of that however they will also become half deaf as their hearing slowly starts to fade. Similarly to the rank before if medical supplies are used it will only heal the poison with the effects lasting afterwards for one minute. The same effects follow for using poison extraction. This poison takes 24 lines to craft

A-Rank
Prerequisite: 150 Iryojutsu, 150 Intelligence
The next rank of poison allows for medical Shinobi to provide a deadly touch to the battlefield. Far deadlier than the previous ranks. When applied to a target it causes t4 poison and reduces the target's Movement speed, OP, EP, and ROP by 40%, robbing the target of their hearing completely as well as their sight partially! For this to be healed one must use either poison extraction or medical supplies, however the medical supplies will not remove the status effects as those fade within a minute after usage. Requires 33 lines to craft.

S-Rank
 Prerequisite: 200 Iryojutsu, 500cc
The final and most deadly type of poison most medical Shinobi know, with it those affected are robbed of their senses. Gaining 5 tiers of poison, their movement speed, OP, ROP, and EP are all reduced by 50% and lose their sight and hearing as well. Medical supplies cannot fully heal this type of poison regardless of how many times used, only reducing the tier of the poison to 1. While poison extraction can work here the person using it has to have an equal or greater Iryojutsu score in comparison to the person who created the poison. Otherwise they too can only heal up to 4 tiers. This poison takes 42 lines to craft

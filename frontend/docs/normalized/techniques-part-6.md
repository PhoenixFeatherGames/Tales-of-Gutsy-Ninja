[BC]Prerequisite 
<p align="center">Must have a tragic yet relatable backstory.</p>
[Bc]Cost:
<p align="center">The castor and target must both be at 50% HP or less, and the castor must find a contradiction in the target's ideology, logic, or reasoning that they intend to challenge.</p>
[Bc]Description:
<p align="center">This technique,  when used with efficient skill, is used to talk adversaries down from their objectives,beliefs, and or ideologies. In order to expertly deploy the Talk no Jutsu, one must engage their empathy as well as their knowledge of their enemy. Without a deep understanding of the opponent’s ideology, as well as their history, one cannot find the flaws in their thinking, nor how to relate to them on a personal basis.</p>

<p align="center">By pinpointing a critical contradiction in their opponents position, may form a connection between their targets and their own through personal similarities and or shared experiences/trauma. Once this bond is formed, they must compete in a battle of wills.</p>

<p align="center">This struggle is fought by wearing down eachother's "Will" Traits, which add together to form a single measure of "Will Power". To chip this trait down, begining with the castor, a party must systematically tear apart their target's position once per turn, reducing their target's Will by an ammount equal to half their Intelligence Trait for each correct statement that is not correctly countered. If the accusation or challenge is successfully rebuted in the first rebuke, you do not lose any room of "Will Power". As one challenger's Will reduces, the other's increases. This however goes both ways, meaning the castor runs the risk of their own stance waivering. If the party's "Will" hits 0, they MUST forfiet. The Will of those involved return to normal by ±10%/Round.</p>

[Bc]Technique:
<p align="center">Ninjutsu</p>
[Bc]Element:
<p align="center">Lightning</p>
[BC]Prerequisite 
<p align="center">One must have 300 Chakra Control and 300 Experience, [Chidori|http://aminoapps.com/p/oxvqdp]</p>
[Bc]Cost:
<p align="center">26 Chakra Points</p>
[Bc]Description:
<p align="center">Like the Chidori, the Lightning Cutter requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, because they are performed in fundamentally the same way: both concentrate lightning chakra in the hand; both are used to rapidly pierce targets; both pose danger to the user without advanced visual or chakra sensing ability. However,  the Raikiri, unlike the Chidori, does not rely on speed, instead proving to be far more versitile and able to produce far more raw power than the Chidori aswell as being able to remain stability held together for a prolonged period of time and used even from an idle position.</p>

<p align="center">If one is hit by this, the target takes melee damage as well as +45 Lightning Damage that also shocks them and makes them Bleed, similar to the Chidori, but may actually be amplified by +20 Damage, +1Bleed, +1 shock for every extra 13 ChP put into it. Being more stable than the Chidori, this jutsu can hold it's shape as long as needed, however,  unless you are able to properly monitor it's chakra flow through specialized dojutsu or enhanced sensing capabilities,  it will harm it's user, causing 10 Damage per round to the castor aswell as +1 burn per tier...</p>

[Bc]Element:
<p align="center">N/A</p>
[BC]Prerequisite 
<p align="center">100 Fuinjutsu, 200 Intelligence</p>
[Bc]Cost:
<p align="center">25oz Ink, 25 Chakra Points per 25 Meters Traveled</p>
[Bc]Description:
<p align="center">Before the Flying Thunder God Technique can be performed, users must first mark a target with their "technique formula" (術式, jutsu-shiki). There is no limit to how many targets can be marked with technique formulas. This marking may be applied to tags, inanimate surfaces, or even living beings!</p>

<p align="center">Once formed, the user must imprint 5 points of their own chakra into the seal for this technique to work in order for it to gain a matching chakra signature to it's programmer. Creating the mark with the [Finger Carving Seal|http://aminoapps.com/p/2fb3qa] or the [Palm Seal| http://aminoapps.com/p/frg34j] can bypass this requirement. This chakra will never fade away, even after the user's death, as long the ink and the marked surface remain intact.</p>

<p align="center">Once the seal is complete, the user can form the seal of comradery with their fingers and INSTANTLY warp to any of their markings, within 1 meter, as long as they are within their chakra sensing range. When used to evade or attack, the user temporarily gains 25% of their max EP, or OP respectively, to their OP/EP of that action/counter!</p>

<p align="center">This is a very advanced healing technique where the user applies their hand to the afflicted or wounded part of the body and sends chakra into it, accelerating the body's natural healing abilities, which also conserves ones own Chakra. Although its most obvious use is as a way of treating external wounds, it can also be used for internal injury or illness as well. This jutsu is able to repair 1 disabled limb, 1% of Bleeding, 1% of Poison, 1% of burn damage, and heal 30 of the patient's total HP.</p>

<p align="center">You may also heal more sooner, healing 1 additional Tier of all status effects and healing 20HP for each aditional 15ChP used.</p>

% of chakra equal to enhancement
 
Description:
 
A special type of Taijutsu that uses the refined chakra control and concentration required in medical ninjutsu to enhance one's strength to monstrous levels. This is done by storing chakra into one's hands or feet, and releasing it onto the target with pinpoint timing.

When activated the castor enhances their strength score by an amount equal to the percentage paid x 4. If one paid 10% of their chakra they would enhance their strength by 40%, so on so forth. This cost is paid once every round and can even be used to enhance the jump distance of the castor by enhancing the strength in one's legs.

> Sennin Mōdo
> [Bcu] Sage Mode

[Bc]Rank:
<p align="center">S-Rank</p>
[Bc]Technique:
<p align="center">Ninjutsu, Senjutsu</p>
[Bc]Element:
<p align="center">N/A</p>
[BC]Prerequisite 
<p align="center">Form a contract with a [Shōkan|http://aminoapps.com/p/4x8fdb] species</p>
[Bc]Cost:
<p align="center">10% Sage Level SChP/ Round*</p>
[Bc]Description:
<p align="center">Sage Mode is an empowered state that can be entered by blending natural energy with one's chakra, creating senjutsu chakra. Sage Mode allows users to tap into the natural force of the world, opening up new techniques to them and allowing them to power up existing ones with the new senjutsu chakra. Senjutsu is a specialised field of techniques that allows the user to sense and then gather natural energy, or Nature Chakra, a far more potent form of chakra than is found inside of individual Shinobi, so one with this sage chakra, may pay 1SChP in place of 2ChP, aswell as push normal jutsu past its normal 10 tier limit, up to 20!</p>

<p align="center">Senjutsu practitioners learn to draw the energy of nature inside of them, blending it with their own chakra.This adds a new dimension of power to the practitioner's chakra, resulting in the creation of "Sage chakra" which may be accessed through a state called "Sage Mode" which gives a significant boost to most stats and offer unique, special traits, depending on contracted beings called Shōkan. But all of this must be learned through gaining the trust of a summoning contract they were allowed to sign by another Sage or Shōkan, and trained in the homelands of said summon, or one must discover such a place themself.</p>

<p align="center">In order for one to actually access Sage Mode and therefore sage chakra, one must have a Senjutsu Score, however,  any score beow 100 will result in an imperfect sage mode, and will forever lock the strength of one's sage mode. In other words, if one have a Senjutsu Score of 50 and enter sage mode, they will never be able to enter a sage mode past 50%, and attempting to enter sage mode with a score any lower than 50 will result in the shinobi mutating into a creature more animal than human, before dying as their body petrifies irreversibley into a stone statue...</p>

<p align="center">In order to enter sage mode, one must remain perfectly still and unmoved, merging Natural Energy with their own chakra to form Sage Chakra. For every round the user meditates, they lose Max ChP=Senjutsu Score, gaining a new Sage Chakra Pool (SChP) = ½ChP transformed. One may only transmutate a percent of their Chakra Pool equal to their Stage of Sage Mode in order to enter the state, otherwise they will lose the gathered chakra. For example, one with Sage mode (50%) could augment up to 50% of their Chakra into Sage Chakra.</p>

<p align="center">Each sage mode grants unique abilities and features that match the species of their contracted Shōkan, however, all share an amplification to the users base stats, amplifying all five base stats by a percentage equal to the level of ones Sage Mode. Perfect Sages show only tinted pigmentations around their eyes, where the further from the perfect union of one's chakra and nature energy results in more facial markings, to more tattooing over the body, and less and less human, showing more and more animalistic qualities. The animalistic traits of lesser sage modes with more feral mutations are actually superior to those granted to sage mode, such as as increased Jumping, Digging, Climbing, or Swimming abilities, etc, etc, etc with possible tails, claws, horns, wings, gills, etc. However,  greater sage modes offer higher stat increases and longer lasting sage modes.</p>

*For exampke, a 50% sage would burn 5 Sage Chakra Points per Round, but a 100% Sage would burn 10SChP/Round.

*While in Sage Mode, the user is treated as a "Sensory Type", now able to sense the chakra signatures around them by concentrating as well as able to supress their own. This extends in a diameter equal to the users ROP+Willl. This is doubled for Shinobi that were already Sensory Types prior to this state of being.

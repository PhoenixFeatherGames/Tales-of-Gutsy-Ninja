⟦ Character Development ⟧ UPDATE CHARACTER SHEETS REGULARLY!

Nature Affinity Your character may choose 2 of any of the 5 elemental nature affinities. Fire (火, Hi), Wind (風, Kaze), Lightning (雷, Kaminari), Earth (土, Tsuchi), Water (水, Mizu). If your Shinobi’s Nature matches their Village’s Nature, or Clan’s Nature, they get a 5% boost to Ninjutsu usage of that nature. Using Ninjutsu that does not match your Ninja’s own nature reduces its effect by 10%. If your Shinobi only has 1 elemental affinity, gain an extra 5% effectiveness to ninjutsu of that nature. For example, all an Sasukebi was only proficient with fire nature, it would be +20% effective (Village, clan, clan effect, and only proficient nature). To become proficient in a new element, you must fill 20 Jutsu Bank slots with ninjutsu of that nature.

Starting Gear All shinobi start with the following gear. Anyone without room to carry this gear may instead get the equivalent worth of Ryō.
All: (1) Headband & (2) Kunai Sand: (3) Senbon Earth: (3) Shuriken Cloud: (3) Senbon Leaf: (3) Shuriken Mist: (3) Senbon Iron: (3) Shuriken Whirlpool: (3) Shuriken Snow: (3) Senbon

EXP/Experience Otherwise known as Skill Points, these are the points you spend to upgrade the following skills, mostly earned from doing Missions. Each of the following 5 Skills may be maxed out to 200, but the players total spendable EXP/Skill Points cap out at 500.

INTelligence This determines how many items your ability to hide, your ability to find hidden players. This also affects DP and ROP.

STRength This determines how much melee damage you do, how long you can hold someone in a grapple or be held in one, and other possible in game uses. 1/2 STR = base melee damage, say from a punch or a kick. This also affects HP.

SPEed This determines how many coordinates (out of Encounter) or meters (in Encounter) you can move on foot without getting tired and or per turn. This also affects OP, EP and Initiative.

STAMina This determines how quickly you can recover after moving your max coordinate spaces before you can move again. Your HP also naturally recovers by Stamina/Day. This also affects HP, DP, EP, OP, and ROP.

WILL This determines, well, your determination, the strength of your spirit… This affects your ability to use and resist Genjutsu and may affect other Jutsu or situations as well. This also affects your Chakra Pool.

Health Points This is equal to (Str+Sta)x2. This determines how much damage you can take before you are Knocked Out or Killed. This recovers by Stamina/Day, or (Sta+2)/Hour, unless in your village, where medical nin will fully heal you within 24 hours.

Defensive Points This is equal to (Int+Sta) and determines how much damage you can block before you start losing HP. This is lowered by will be damage in place of HP. If you are only threatened with status effects, but no damage, you may not use DP to Block. Your DP recovers automatically after encounters/missions.

Evasion Points This is equal to (Int+Spd) and determines how much damage you can dodge before you start losing HP, lowering from dodging OP or ROP. This also affects Initiative. Your EP recovers automatically after encounters/missions.

CHakra Pool (Int+Sta+Will) equals how much chakra your body holds. You spend Chakra to perform most Jutsu, as well other possible techniques. If your chakra were to become negative for any reason, it would also reduce your HP. This recovers by Will/Day, or (Will+2)/Hour, unless in your village, where medical nin will fully recover your Chakra within 24 hours.

Offensive Points This is equal to (Speed+Stamina)/2. This can be affected by traits or even Jutsu, as well as situational circumstances or status effects. This is how much EP your target must spend to counter a melee attack.

Ranged OP This is equal to (Int+Sta)/2 and adds to ROP or Length of mid/long ranged weapons or attacks such as Jutsu, as well as equal to their effective range in meters.

INTiative This is equal to (EP+OP) and determines turn or action order in the case of multiple parties or conflicting actions, deciding what action or player occurred or attacks first, second, third, etc. Those with Initiatives multiple higher get to take multiple turns in the same round, before those with less, ie, someone with Initiative: 100 is fighting someone with Initiative: 50, they get 2 turns (1 action per turn), where the other person only gets 1 turn. When fighting in groups, it will look like this: A=100, B=50 vs C=100. (A,C,B). C gets 2 actions, B gets 1 action. The number of turns is determined downward from the highest initiative, not upward from the lowest. Those actions are split into turns, so the fighters are all limited to what they can normally do in a single round or distance they can travel between their turns, and limited to 1 action per turn. In the other scenario, Turn order would look like this: C>A>B>C>A>B.

Jutsu Score There are 7 classes of trainable, useable Ninja techniques, these are called Jutsu. Your Village gives you 10 assigned points, your clan offers bonuses and penalties for some, and you begin with 5 points of your own to spend freely. These Jutsu Scores raise naturally by 1 point for every 10 Jutsu (2 min minimum) written using them. The total sum of your Jutsu Scores would be documented as your “Chakra Control”. It should be noted Jutsu are worth more or less depending on their rank, E-Rank Jutsu: 1 Jutsu Slot, D-Rank Jutsu: 3 Jutsu Slots, C-Rank Jutsu: 5 Jutsu Slots, B-Rank Jutsu: 10 Jutsu Slots, A-Rank Jutsu: 15 Jutsu Slots, S-Rank Jutsu: 20 Jutsu Slots.

Ninjutsu Techniques that are performed by molding chakra in a variety of physical ways, mostly elemental.
Genjutsu Techniques that rather than physical hazards, manipulate or fool the targets mind via illusions.
Taijutsu These techniques do not require the use of chakra by default and may be learned and used by any. These techniques are strictly martial arts, hand to hand combat.
Fuinjutsu A special form of brush techniques, ninja write special calligraphic seals to perform a variety of things, most commonly sealing larger things into a confined space, or summoning them from.
Iryojutsu Simply put, this refers to your ability to heal yourself or others via any method able. This requires practice and a comprehensive understanding of the body.
Bukijutsu Rather than learnable techniques, Bukijutsu, as well as the following, are raised simply by doing. This is honed by using simple, basic, weaponry and tools.
Kenjutsu Very similar to Bukijutsu, Kenjutsu refers to the use of more advanced or specialized weaponry, like swords.

When your “Potential” (Experience+Chakra Control) reaches 100, you qualify for the Chunin exams! Succeeding allows you to become a Chunin, failing allows free entry into the next Chunin exams. Once your Potential reaches 200, and you are a Chunin, you will be given a special mission, leading a team of Genin, promoting you to Jonin! 500 potential recognizes you as a special Jonin who is respected highly among their direct peers, but not quite legendary. By 1000 Potential, you are a Legendary Shinobi and allowed to apply for the position of a Kage, in which you must challenge a current Kage before a Daimyo and their Advisor and gain their permission to form your own village/unclaimed village within said Daimyo’s country.

Shinobi Ranks
25–99 Potential = Genin 100+ (but yet to pass Chunin exams) = Special Genin (Genin+) 100–199 = Chunin 200+ (Before Proctoring Chunin Exams) = Special Chunin (Chunin+) 200–499 = Jonin 500–999 = Special Jonin (Jonin+) 500–999 NPC = Special Jonin (Anbu) 500+ = Advisor (Kage’s Aid) 1000+ (Not Village Leader) = Legendary Shinobi / Sannin (If Sage) 1000+ (Village Leader) = Kage

Your rank directly affects what Missions you may perform.
Those who are approved to NPC missions will earn the title on their profile of “Anbu”. When those with the Anbu (NPC), Advisor (Curator), or Daimyo (Leader) title NPC for missions, they receive reward equal to 25% of the total ryo and EXP, which they may distribute amongst any of their characters.

⟦ PVP ⟧ If OP or ROP takes your EP past 0, use what was left over to take away from Damage. ie, 15 Damage, 10 OP, 5 EP left. OP takes away your EP, so you do get hit, but because you had 5 EP, only take 10 damage instead of 15. This is true with surplus damage going past your DP.
If you use your EP or DP but do not have enough to counter the full attack, reduce the damage by any remaining points you had. If the previous situation happens and you would have suffered one status effect, you may trade it for a different one, other than for Poison or Burn. If you would have suffered multiple status effects, you may ignore one. If the leftover EP and or DP completely voided damage, you must take a status effect other than Poison or Burn.
To run away from/Escape an encounter you must meet two conditions. You must run away for at least 100 meters and spend at least 3 turns in running away.
PVP is allowed, but will only offer Jutsu points, no EXP.
When HP hits 0, you may be Knocked Out or Killed at the discretion of the one who took your HP to 0 and or depending if the damage was lethal or non-lethal.
When in an encounter, each round is 6 seconds. When out of an encounter, anything that relies on “rounds” will use it in minutes instead. When in an encounter, anything that relies on “minutes” will be equal to 10 Rounds.

⟦ Special Movement ⟧ Round 1 Meter to 3 Feet.
Land Speed When in an encounter and trying to judge range, treat your “Speed” Trait as your Land speed equal “Speed” meters per Minute/Round. This cannot be abused to attack someone then run out of range. If not in an encounter, “Speed”x2 = miles/coordinates one can move before needing to recover. This is mostly used for very specific situations or events.
Swimming A players Swim Speed = 1.5 “Speed” meters per minute/round. 1/4th “Stamina” determines how many rounds/minutes you can hold your breath. After this, you start “Suffocating”.
Jumping Your Jumping Distance = 40% “Speed” in feet jumped standing. This is doubled if with a running start. One’s Jumping Height would be 160% of your speed in inches, or doubled if with a running start. You may use your action to have an ally assist your jump, adding half their strength to your speed to increase jump Height/Distance.
Climbing One’s Climb Distance/Speed would be 1.5 “Speed” meters per Minute/Round. This quite obviously must be done on a climbable surface.
Digging The size of a hole you may dig, in a diggable surface such as the dirt, is equal (Speed+Strength)=10 inches per Round. The size would be assumed as a cubic like area with equal dimensions. Damage from Weapons or DP from Gear may be added to your “Dig” score to increase your digging ability.

⟦ Falling ⟧ When you fall, you take incrementally raised damage for every 10 ft fallen. Fall damage is halved when landing in water. A shinobi will not suffer fall damage when jumping and falling from their own natural jump height.
| Distance | Damage | Effects |
| 10 ft | 3 | — |
| 20 ft | 6 | T1 Prone |
| 30 ft | 9 | T2 Prone, 1 Temp Disabled Limb |
| 40 ft | 15 | T3 Prone, 2 Temp Disabled Limb |
| 50 ft | 24 | T4 Prone, 3 Temp Disabled Limb |
| 60 ft | 39 | T5 Prone, 4 Temp Disabled Limb |
| 70 ft | 63 | T6 Prone, 1 Disabled Limb |
| 80 ft | 102 | T7 Prone, 2 Disabled Limb, T1 Bleed |
| 90 ft | 165 | T8 Prone, 3 Disabled Limb, T2 Bleed |
| 100 ft | 267 | T9 Prone, 4 Disabled Limb, T3 Bleed |

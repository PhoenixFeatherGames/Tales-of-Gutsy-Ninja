The Rasengan does not require\u0000hand seals\u0000to perform. Once it is formed, it also does not require any additional chakra to sustain it, which means that there is no definite limit to how long the Rasengan can be maintained, however,  more chakra may be pumped into it to increase it's size and power. However, the Rasengan will dissipate if it collides with something, even if it's an unintended target. On contact, the Rasengan grinds into its target, propels them along the Rasengan's trajectory - either away from the user or into the ground beneath them - and at some point bursts, causing severe damage at the point of contact. Though not as masterful as it's shape transformation, givin it's elementless nature, one may add properties of an elemenral nature into this technique via [|] [Chakra Flow|http://aminoapps.com/p/6ce2ro] [|].</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">Hitting someone with this deals melee damage once it hits them and the raw energy causes 1\u0000\u0000Burn, from there, the Rasengan launches the target 10 feet in the direction of its trajectory before erupting and dealing 40 Damage! Every additional 13ChP put in, incrementally increases the size of the Rasengan, (6\", 12\", 18\", etc), and increases the distance by 5 feet, the damage by +20, and +1 burn.</p>\n\n> Chidori\n> [Bcu] One Thousand Birds\n\n[Bc]Rank:\n<p align=\"center\">A-Rank</p>\n[Bc]Technique:\n<p align=\"center\">Ninjutsu</p>\n[Bc]Element:\n<p align=\"center\">Lightning</p>\n[BC]Prerequisite \n<p align=\"center\">One must have 200 Chakra Control and 200 Experience</p>\n[Bc]Cost:\n<p align=\"center\">22 Chakra Points</p>\n[Bc]Description:\n<p align=\"center\">To perform, the user first gathers lightning to their hand; the high concentration of electricity produces a sound reminiscent of many birds chirping, hence the name.\u0000Once the chakra is gathered, users charge at their target and thrust the Chidori into them, piercing them and typically causing fatal damage. Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it's used makes it useful for assassinations. If one is hit by this, the target takes melee damage as well as +35 Lightning Damage that also shocks them and makes them Bleed. Unlike many other jutsu, this jutsu can not be improved by adding more chakra into it.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">The speed at which the Chidori is performed, despite being one of its greatest assets, also represents one of its biggest drawbacks. On one hand, ½ of the distance traveled between point A to point B is added to this attack's OP and Damage. However, users move at their target so fast that its causes a\u0000tunnel vision-like effect for them. Because they charge in a straight line it is easy for opponents to attack them, and because of the tunnel vision it is difficult for the user to see these attacks, much less react to them, unable to Evade or Defend from counter attacks. For this reason, most ninja cannot use the Chidori safely.</p>\n\n> Doton: Gōremu no Jutsu\n \n> Earth Release: golem technique\n \n \nRank:\n \nA-Rank, Active, Reactive\n \nTechnique:\n \nNinjutsu\n \nElement:\n \nEarth\n \nPrerequisite \n 100 chakra control\n \nCost:\n \n20 Chakra Points and 40Lbs of Earth\n\n \nDescription:\n \nThis technique allows the user to create a large, humanoid creature composed of rock and stone in order to protect and aid it's user as an extension of their body!\n\nThis golem is completely controlled by the caster, sharing their EP, but has it's base damage and Speed of 10, with DP of 30, standing 2 meters (6ft) tall! This golem is to be controlled via physical contact with the user, if the user ever stops touching it the golem will becone inert  and collapse. With every extra 15Chp and 30ib of earth poured into this golem increases its damage and Speed  by +10, and it's DP by 30, as well as increases it's size by +2m(6').\n\n> Ingen Ketsugō Sakushi\n \n> String Bean Binding Illusion\n \n \nRank:\n \nA-Rank, Active\n \nTechnique:\n \nGenjutsu(Unsubtle)\n \nElement:\n \nYin\n \nPrerequisite \n Must know Tree Binding Death, Invisibility, 100 Genjutsu score\n \nCost:\n \n30chp\n \nDescription:\n \nA typical technique amongst the members of the\u0000Kurama clan. The illusion shows the user disappear before the opponent is surrounded by several bean vines that bind their body and lift them into the air. A bean pod then rises from the ground which opens to reveal the user, ready to strike.\n\nAs this technique is cast upon a target within ROP range Several bean vines then wrap around the target rendering them grappled for an amount of rounds equal to the castor's Will + Genjutsu vs the target's will. A unique aspect of this technique in comparison to it's parent jutsu is the aspect that two targets can be effected by this jutsu, however the castor must instead grapple their will + Genjutsu vs the two target's will + will ÷ 2\n\nWith every 15chp the jutsu allows for one more person to be added into the fray, allowing for a total of 11 targets at tier ten. However as a result with each added person their wills must be added together and divided by the amount affected.\n\n> Tenohira Fūin\n> [Bcu] Palm Seal\n\n[Bc]Rank:\n<p align=\"center\">A-Rank, Passive</p>\n[Bc]Technique:\n<p align=\"center\">Fuinjutsu, Ninjutsu</p>\n[Bc]Element:\n<p align=\"center\">Yin-Yang</p>\n[BC]Prerequisite \n<p align=\"center\">30 Fuinjutsu, 200 Chakra Control, [Finger Carving Seal|http://aminoapps.com/p/2fb3qa]</p>\n[Bc]Cost:\n<p align=\"center\">25ChP/20oz Ink</p>\n[Bc]Description:\n<p align=\"center\">In essense, this is an advanced version of the Finger Carving Seal, however,  instead of meticulously carving seals, your chakra control is so fine, your caligraphy so fine and practiced, that you can mentally shape the characters with your own chakra through you open palm, able to swiftly imprint the formula of your technique by burning your chakra into the point of contact!</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">Seals made in this way will remain even after the castor dies, even if visable markings are removed, as long as the chakra remains or the target area remains intact. This technique may only imprint up to 20oz, (25 ChP), worth of marking per use.</p>\n\n> Mahi Fuda\n> [Bcu] Paralysis Tag\n\n[Bc]Rank:\n<p align=\"center\">A-Rank,  Active,  Reactive</p>\n[Bc]Technique:\n<p align=\"center\">Fuinjutsu</p>\n[Bc]Element:\n<p align=\"center\">Yin, Earth</p>\n[BC]Prerequisite \n<p align=\"center\">30 Fuinjutsu Score</p>\n[Bc]Cost:\n<p align=\"center\">7oz Ink, 1 Empty Tag, 7ChP/Meter Distance, 7ChP/Round</p>\n[Bc]Description:\n<p align=\"center\">Paralysis Tags\u0000(\u0000\u0000\f, \u0000Mahi Fuda), also called Petrify Paper, are scraps of paper inscribed with a special Fuinjutsu text. Infused with chakra, they will completely stun whomever attached to after a set amount of time, or remotely remotely. The tags can be attached to a surface or wrapped around a weapon to be thrown at an enemy. They are very versatile and one of the basic ninja tools. They work even under heavy rain. When an paralysis tag is triggered remotely, ninja need to use a hand seal, requiring two hands.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">The paralysis has a grapple score of 30 to resist with one's raw Strength, or lasts for 1 minute (60 seconds/10 rounds), or until removed/destroyed. The effect, and chakra cost, is increased by adding more tags, but each tag after the first is only half as effective, adding +1 Stun, but half as strong, and costs half as much chakra. One who knows this technique may also spend 4oz of ink to disable another's petrifying paper and use it as their own.</p>\n\n> Chakura Fūin Fuda\n> [Bcu] Chakra Sealing Tag\n\n[Bc]Rank:\n<p align=\"center\">A-Rank,  Active,  Reactive</p>\n[Bc]Technique:\n<p align=\"center\">Fuinjutsu</p>\n[Bc]Element:\n<p align=\"center\">Yin, Yang</p>\n[BC]Prerequisite \n<p align=\"center\">30 Fuinjutsu Score</p>\n[Bc]Cost:\n<p align=\"center\">7oz Ink, 1 Empty Tag, 7ChP/Meter Distance, 7ChP/Round</p>\n[Bc]Description:\n<p align=\"center\">Chakra Sealing Tags\u0000(\u0000\u0000\f, \fhakura-f\u0000in  fuda), also called Chakra Suppressors, are scraps of paper inscribed with a special Fuinjutsu text. Infused with chakra, they can be activated after a set amount of time, or remotely. The tags can be attached to a surface or wrapped around a weapon to be thrown. They are very versatile and one of the basic ninja tools. They work even under heavy rain. When an chakra sealing tag is triggered remotely, ninja need to use a hand seal, requiring two hands.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">Contact with the the tag locks the chakra of those in by +10%/round, and lasts for 1Min(60seconds/10 Rounds), or until removed/destroyed. By placing 3 or more tags 1 meter from eachother, in a shape, not a line, this becomes an erea of effect, reaching up to a 10m diameter with 10 tags as their sealing energies connect, sealing up to 100% of the target's Chakra.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">This tag seals the targets connection to their chakra network with grapple score of 30 to resist with one's power of Will, or lasts for 1 minute (60 seconds/10 rounds), or until removed/destroyed. The effect is increased by adding more tags, but only increases the effect by 10%, the duration and binding strength, but also the chakra cost, decreases by 50%. One who knows this technique may also spend 4oz of ink to disable another's petrify paper and use it as their own.</p>\n\n> Senp\u00014: Hoh\u00014\n> [Bcu] Sage Art: Step Method\n\n[Bc]Rank:\n<p align=\"center\">B-Rank, Passive</p>\n[Bc]Technique:\n<p align=\"center\">Senjutsu</p>\n[Bc]Element:\n<p align=\"center\">N/A</p>\n[BC]Prerequisite \n<p align=\"center\">Chakra Control 200, Sage Mode, [Tree Climbing Jutsu|http://aminoapps.com/p/yznhuf8], [Water Walking Jutsu|http://aminoapps.com/p/5rfr16] [|]</p>\n[Bc]Cost:\n<p align=\"center\">13 Sage Chakra Points per Minute active.</p>\n[Bc]Description:\n<p align=\"center\">Hoh\u00014\u0000or Agility (歩法, hoh\u00014; lit. step method) is an ancient technique said to have been developed by a sage long ago amidst fighting a god of death while observing how the Shinigami seemed to be walking on solid air, or so the legend goes...</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">Eventually, the safe had realized it wasn't air, but rather, they had been collecting some sort of energy beneath their feet to stand on, energy that would be invisible to the naked, mortal eye... The sage would use similar methods they knew to walk up trees and walls, or across bodies of water, to collect, mold, and shape the Natural Chakra that existed all around them to form similar, solid, platforms to travel across. Some say they used this technique to escape the Pure Lands, others say they used the Shinigami's own technique to defeat them, and earn there freedom from the afterlife...</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">By using this technique,  the user is freely able to walk, run, jump, and travel in a three dimensional space in any direction as they please as if ground existed where it does not. Even if the user were to fall from 100 meters, they may instead fall and \"land\" a mere two meters down by forming these invisible 1\u0000x1m square platforms from seemingly no where beneath their hands or feet. The only ones able to see or sense these platforms are those who are also able to harness Nature or Sage Chakra, or, those who possess the Rennigan. If struck directly by any decent amount of force, these platforms completely shatter, providing no pritection or cover of any sort besides harmless debris,  deflections or pressures.</p>"

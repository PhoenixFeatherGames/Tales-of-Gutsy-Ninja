[cu]Caterpillar Body:
[C]Half Akimichi may still use the chakra they store to perform the body-expanding "[Partial Expansion Technique|http://aminoapps.com/p/rmp0lt]", but Akimichi techniques perform at half efficiency, allowing them to increase the size of their limbs or torso and grab, smash, or slam anything in their way, but at -50% effect as their body is less pre-disposed to the dramatic alterations! 

[Cu]Calorie Management 
[C]Typically, Akimichi may freely convert the calories they consume into chakra, hence their husky physique and frequent eating habits. This ability is refered to as "Calorie Control" and is the core technique to the Akimichi clans Hijutsu, and is added to their list of Justu Skills. They must try to track their calories for this reason, getting a pool of Calories they can safley burn equal to 3× their HP, which recovers at the same rate as their HP, or by eating, gaining +100Cal per half rank of food items. The Akimichi developed the Three Coloured Pills for easier use of this technique, however, the use of these pills carry great risks. However, it takes more time for half Akimichi to master, so genin start with a set of 3 colored pills of special hijutsu medicine in case of absolute emergencies to force this power, allowed to carry no more than one of any single pill at any given time. These pills however pose a larger risk to those without the pure Akimichi physique, and offer less reward. If all three pills are taken, their effects are stacked together, good and bad, and force the Half-Akimichi into a Psuedo-Butterfly Mode!

•Green Spinach Pill <This converts 5% of one's Max HP and turns it into fuel, gaining +5% Chakra and allowing them to burn 20 more calories past the safe amount, (negative number if past 0).

•Red Chilli Pill <This converts 33% of one's Max HP and turns it into fuel, gaining +33% Chakra and allowing them to burn 80 more calories past the safe amount, also increasing  the user's  Strength, Stamina, and Will by 33% for 6 rounds, however,  this also causes 8% Poison and a 17% Debuff to Str, Sta, and Spe until Calories are restored.> | B

[Cu]Feline Similarities
[C]As descendant members of this clan, these shinobi have certain feline characteristics, including tails, and greatly enhanced senses, especially their sense of smell, turning any stealth attempts against them into half stealth, increasing their their ability to find those hiding by 50%.

Their life of hammering and shaping their wears on their off time built their bodies up, and thus have also tapped into the ability to throw 60% strength into their blows instead of just 50% with (1H)Weapons, or 80% with (2H)Weapons! Unlike fully focused Shinobi, these reserves don't typically go in the front lines of "missions", but instead earn more of their Experience from forging items, weapons, and armor, earning Ryo from selling these wares. Where as Shinobi are decent at crafting items together, Blacksmiths can also build weapons and armor from the ground up! You must write 5 lines per half rank, to forge gear, (the lowest, D-, is  lines, D=5, D+=10, C-=15, etc). Instead of just learning Jutsu, they get a "Craft Bank" that determines how many things they know how to build at any time, where for example, the "Blueprints" for a D- weapon, a "D- Blueprint", would cost 1,000 Ryo, and take 1 "Craft Bank" Slot, (D=2k Ryo and 2 Slots, D+= 3k and 3 slots, etc), but then they would be able to craft that Weapon wherever and whenever they wish, and attempt selling it at any price they wish, aswell as gain EXP of a mission equivalent to a rank below the item's worth, D-Rank being the lowest.

[Cu]Crossed Family Tree: 
[C]The clan has traditionally been separated into two parts: the main house (宗家, Sōke) and the branch house (分家, Bunke), a system that protects the secrets of the Byakugan from outsiders. The main house runs the family while the branch house protects it. However,  it is strictly taboo to ever intermix between these branches, punishable for their degeneracy by banishment or even death if they were to ever breed and birth what would be deemed as an abomination, spawned from a Rotten House, (朽家, Kyūke)...
•Kyūke: The kin of the rotton family do not have eyes as great as those of the head house, but better than those of the branch house, seeing 50% farther. Their Tenketsu are not as streamlined as that of the branch family, but more fine then that of the main family, expeling chakra with 50% more force.

[cu]Hungry Caterpillar:
[C]Half Akimichi may still use the chakra they store to perform the body-expanding "[Partial Expansion Technique|http://aminoapps.com/p/rmp0lt]", but Akimichi techniques perform at half efficiency, allowing them to increase the size of their limbs or torso and grab, smash, or slam anything in their way, but at -50% effect as their body is less pre-disposed to the dramatic alterations! This may be overcome however from their other bloodline if they are using the Gomu clan's "Rubber Body Technique"

[Cu]Calorie Management 
[C]Typically, Akimichi may freely convert the calories they consume into chakra, hence their husky physique and frequent eating habits. This ability is refered to as "Calorie Control" and is the core technique to the Akimichi clans Hijutsu, and is added to their list of Justu Skills. They must try to track their calories for this reason, getting a pool of Calories they can safley burn equal to 3× their HP, which recovers at the same rate as their HP, or by eating, gaining +100Cal per half rank of food items. The Akimichi developed the Three Coloured Pills for easier use of this technique, however, the use of these pills carry great risks. However, it takes more time for half Akimichi to master, so genin start with a set of 3 colored pills of special hijutsu medicine in case of absolute emergencies to force this power, allowed to carry no more than one of any single pill at any given time. These pills however pose a larger risk to those without the pure Akimichi physique, and offer less reward. If all three pills are taken, their effects are stacked together, good and bad, and force the Half-Akimichi into a Psuedo-Butterfly Mode!

•Green Spinach Pill <This converts 5% of one's Max HP and turns it into fuel, gaining +5% Chakra and allowing them to burn 20 more calories past the safe amount, (negative number if past 0).

•Red Chilli Pill <This converts 33% of one's Max HP and turns it into fuel, gaining +33% Chakra and allowing them to burn 80 more calories past the safe amount, also increasing  the user's  Strength, Stamina, and Will by 33% for 6 rounds, however,  this also causes 8% Poison and a 17% Debuff to Str, Sta, and Spe until Calories are restored.> | B

[cu]Elastic Body
[C]These shinobi share the blood with some alleged thieves who long ago were said to have stolen a rotten sappling from the World Tree, giving their bodies elastic properties. As such, they gain "Gomujutsu" to their Jutsu Skill list, which can be trained by using Rubber Style techniques, which are only half as strong in effect and drawback as that of a pure blooded Gomu, starting with "[Gomu Gomu Pistoru|http://aminoapps.com/p/yfa0uro]", along with the inability to swim, becoming "Prone" if enveloped in water. 
[Cu]The Goal of Dieting
[C]Distantly related to those who dined centuries ago on the rubber fruit, they inherited a natural  +25% boost to their Chakra and EP! They may also supplement half of the chakra cost of their Gomujutsu by burning calories, (10Cal/1ChP), with their Akimichi bloodline's Calorie Control!

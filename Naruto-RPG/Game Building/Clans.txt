[Bcu][|] Blacksmith [|]

[Bc]Blacksmiths, (鍛冶屋, Kajiya), are unique specialists, artists focussed more on the weaponry of war than the humanity of it, believing the best weapons are artificial,  not human, in nature. In other words, Human weapons are only as good as the equipment their are given, and tools are more reliable than the people that use them, meaning the more industrialized armies prevail. 

[Bc]Instead of using the ranking system of Shinobi, or clan names, Kajiya are recognized by their artisan skill:
[Cu]The Kajiya Version of Rank:
>25-99 Potential= Apprentice Blacksmith
>100-199= Practitioner Blacksmith
>200-499= Professional Blacksmith
>500-999 (not Moderator)= Expert Blacksmith
>500-999 (Moderator)= Master Blacksmith
>1000+ (Not Leader)= Legendary Blacksmith
>1000+ (Leader) = Grandmaster Blacksmith

[cu]Craftsmanship:
[C]Kajiya do not practice any form of Ninjutsu or Chakra molding of any nature, focussed solely on creating the weapons and armors of their land, and how to properly use them. Instead, They gain the Fōjijutsu skill, which reduces the line count needed to craft by -1 for every 10 points, (Minimum 1 line needed), this score increases by +1 for every 20 lines written. Their life of hammering and shaping their wears over flaming hot kilms however built their iron bodies, and have also mastered the ability to throw 75% of their Strength into their strikes with 1 Handed weapons, or use 100% of their Strength with 2 Handed weapons! Unlike Shinobi, it is almost entirely unheard of Blacksmiths going on "missions", but instead earn their Experience from forging items, weapons, and armor, earning Ryo soley from selling these wares. Where as Shinobi are decent at crafting items together, Blacksmiths can also build weapons and armor from the ground up! You must write 3 lines per half rank, to forge gear, (the lowest, D-, is 3 lines, D=6, D+=9, C-=12, etc). Instead of learning Jutsu, their "Craft Bank" determines how many things they know how to build at any time, where for example, the "Blueprints" for a D- weapon, a "D- Blueprint", would cost 1,000 Ryo, and take 1 "Craft Bank" Slot, (D=2k Ryo and 2 Slots, D+= 3k and 3 slots, etc), but then they would be able to craft that Weapon wherever they wish, and attempt selling it at any price they wish, aswell as gain EXP of an equivalent ranking mission.

[Bcu][|] Uzumaki [|]

[Bc]The almost strictly red haired Uzumaki's skill with fūinjutsu earned them both respect and fear throughout the ninja world. At some point after Warring States Period, some of the world's nations banded together to destroy Uzushiogakure, believing the village was too powerful to be allowed to continue. However, the Uzumaki had formed intermediary bonds between the conflicting clans of Senju and Uchiha, leading to Konoha's support. Following this, the villages chose to symbolise their alliance by adding the Uzumaki's emblem to Konoha's flak jackets.

Many believed the first wife's lies, causing the entire Chinoike clan to be banished from the country, forced to settle in the Valley of Hell in the Land of Hot Water.

[|] Gomu Gomu Clan [|]
 

 
This clan is said to descend from of a band of ancient thieves who stole a rotten sapling that fell from the world tree planted by a goddess long ago. They ate this sapling, believing it to be fruit of the tree that granted the godess, Princess Kaguya Ōtsutsuki her power. While this did give them great power, making them one of the first humans with chakra, it came at the cost of their ability to swim, making their body far too weak to move and causing them to sink like stone. This special chakra did however have one more unique sap like property to it, it altered their chakra to be able to temporarily turn their bodies as elastic as rubber and as malleable as gum! With the powers granted by this accursed sappling, the thieves descendants went on to become a clan known for inovative techniques and aloof behavior. Many oddly enough becoming famous pirates and rogues. Now exsisting in Uzushoigakure as a thriving clan, who refer to the Kekkei Genkai as Gomuton, Rubber Release.

Any members of this clan are granted "Gomujutsu" to the their Jutsu Skill list, which can be trained by using Rubber Style techniques and start with the C-rank Ninjutsu [|] Rubber Body [|]. 

Theive's Curse
A unqiue disadvantage however that cursed this clan is that any Shinobi with gomu chakra in their body gain's two tier's of prone for every turn submerged underwater, more than half their body needs to be under water for the cursed chakra to weaken their limbs, they're unable to use jutsu while submerged as well if said jutsu takes chakra. Half clan's or less gain 1 tier of prone per turn.

The Will of D.
As Descendants of those who dined centuries ago on the rubber fruit, they inherited what they call The Will of D.! It may never be known if it was a byproduct of how they attained chakra, or a natural disposition from the unyeilding will and resilience of their ancestors. Members born into this clan gain +50% to both their chakra and Ep.

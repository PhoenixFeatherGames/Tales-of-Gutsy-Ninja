[Bc]Description:
[C]Fyūjon is a technique said to beings from an extinct clan, of another world, or even from the pure land... It is a short series of poses that are performed by two Shinobi of roughly equal potential and roughly equal size. To correctly perform the Fusion, the fusees must strike the poses in a perfectly symmetrical image of one another. The result of a correctly performed Fusion Dance is a superior being whose power is the median of it's two parts, however, with full abilities of both!

[C]The two users of this technique must perform it simultaneously within 1 meter range of eachother, resulting in a new being whom's actions are shared between the two users. The fusese stats are both split in half as 50% of their individual chakra is spent, but as their bodies and souls merge into one, their stats are aswell, and this new body has full access to the inventories and abilities of both parties, and maybe more!  The name of this union usually takes on the first half of the party with the more passive or submissive personality, and the second half of the party with the more dominant personality, (Domi"nant" + "Submi"ssive = Subminant), however, this new being is niether or, but a merged personality of both! This fusion lasts for 3 minutes (30 rounds), or until the new entity's HP or ChP reaches 0. After defusing, the damage taken to the union is split between the two partys as well as any remaining chakra.

Description:
 
This cursed jutsu was created by a iwagakure medical shinobi who wanted to bring back their dead comrades, orginally created in an effort of kindness the jutsu was stolen and used to commit atrocities. Since then this jutsu was forbidden in iwagakure and any records of it have been erased. It use chakra infused dirt that is stuffed inside a dead persons body to bring back their body however in a mindless, easy to control state by the re-animator, but can only bring them back at a fraction of their old selves.

By using earth style to stuff dirt inside of a corpse the user can infuse 12 chakra points of their own to re-animate the dead, and restore their body with they chakra imbued earth. These newly undead pawns are completely under the users control and shall follow the castor’s will to the best of their ability, but unable to perform complex actions, restricted to 5 word instructions, and have only 20% of their former power restored. These empty shells are unable to speak, communicate, or perform any sort of jutsu, acting only on instinct and the will of their master, however, their lack of mind makes them immune to mental attacks, and their reliance on instinct grant them “Hightened Senses”, and use their full strength for their attacks.

Ironically, the epitome of this uniquely powerful earth technique requires the assistance of lightning! A Cadaver resurected upon being struck by the full force of a lightning bolt will infuse with it’s energy and power. This new macabe golem of flesh and death will almost look truly alive again, and be restored to 40% of their power in life prior to death... These bodies do have their own minds however their Will and existence are still tethered to their master, bound to follow up to 10 word commands to the best of their ability. The "Hightened  Senses" and use of full strength are lost to these cadavers, however, they have regained ths ability to use complex tools aswell as perform more complex tasks, such as speaking and performing jutsu.

The total amount of pawns under the caster is limited by their own Will. The sum of the Wills of those risen may not surpass that if the castor. If the castor wills it, or dies, all they have re-animated shall fall. Those risen may go no farther from the castor than miles equal to the castors Will. Bodies risen in the most basic way may only last for 24 hours, however, those restored more fully via lightning last for 168 hours. Any and all resurrected bodies gain a poison status to all their attacks and can cause bleed from their nails or teeth.

[Bsc]Description:
[CS]After the hand seals are performed, the user's soul is partly separated from their body and suspended behind them. Behind their soul appears the Shinigami, which restrains their soul with its hair. Only the summoner is able to see the Shinigami at this point. After a few moments, the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm, finishing the following round. It then drives it's arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul. Targets are unableable to see the Shinigami until it's in contact with their soul unless they have special Doujutsu to see the silohuette of chakra.

[Cs]To make contact with the target, the user must grab them, or make a ranged attack, using their Will instead of ROP with a 50%chance to auto hit if the target is in range and unable to see the Shinigami, (25% f8r Byakugan/Sharingan, 0% auto hit for those with Rennigan), using their own body, or Shadow Clones, as an extension to the Shinigami's grasp. While the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled, and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu. With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. The target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their stomach. With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul. The summoner for the next 2 minutesl/rounds can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed. The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the Pure Land, instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity...

[Cs]For every 1 point of your Max HP&ChP, you may seal 2 points of target max HP&CHP. You may seal 1 limb (causing them to lose feeling and slowly rot) for every 20% of their max HP taken, 1 Inner Gate for every 13% of max target ChPsealed, or or divide the spirit in equal parts, such as splitting the target's Yin and Yang halves of Chakra (50% ChP&HP) or percentile portions (may also effect stats). No matter what, the user's soul will be consumed by the Grim Reaper, aswell as any target the sealed within themself, but during this process, the user may split their target's soul(s) However they wish among other targets, willing or otherwise. 

[Cs]The only way to free a soul from the Shinigami is known to By high ranking Uzumaki. Someone must done the sacred Shinigami mask to summon the god of death, then slit their own stomach open, freeing whatever souls they wish from the Shinigami's own stomach...

[Bsc]Description:
[SC]The Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation binds the soul of a deceased person to a living vessel, restoring them as they were when they were alive in order to do their summoner's bidding. It was originally created by the second Hokage, some time after which he declared it a kinjutsu. 

[Sc]Before this technique can be performed, the user must first acquire some of the DNA of the person they intend to reincarnate. The soul of the intended reincarnated must also reside in the Pure Land; souls trapped in the stomach of the Shinigami, for example, cannot be reincarnated so long as they reside there. A living sacrifice is also required for the reincarnated soul to use as a vessel. To actually perform the Impure World Reincarnation, the DNA of the person to be reincarnated is smeared on a special scroll, each scroll size being able to hold an additional contract, the smallest scroll able to hold 1 contract. Once the scroll is activated, the remains spread out in the form of a special seal with the living sacrifice in the centre. Then dust and ash encase the sacrifice's body, giving them the same appearance that the reincarnated had at the time of their death.

[Sc]The Edo Shinobi has now been created. An Edo Tensei (ET) will never be as strong as it was in life, their Traits and Skills being 50% of what they were in life, but keep their Jutsu bank and can never run out of chakra or be killed, regenerating one of every applied status effect aswell as 10% EP, DP,  HP and ChP per round. The only ways to defeat an ET are by killing the castor,  if the ET are sealed, if the ET reach true closure, if the ET are deactivated by the castor, or if the ET themself know this jutsu and are given free will may release themself aswell. The ET are bound by the summoner's Will, and can break free of their masters control if their own Will is greater, or combined Will if Summoner has multiple ET. If the castor wishes for more control, they must write a "Mind Earasure Tag", tie or wrap it onto a kunai, and insert it into the back of the ET's head. The castor now has 3 options;
[S]•Leave the ET with free will and 50% of their power. 
[S]•Instruct the ET to commit to an objective,  to which they will do to their best ability regardless of their mental willingness, but at 25% of their original power.
[S]•The castor may take full mental and control of the ET if they are able to sense them, but the castor is immobile while their conciousness pilots the Edo, which also limits the ET to 25% of it's original power.

[Sc]The Edo Tensei are technically summons, so must be stored in  typically XL Containers,  such as coffins, when not in use. They may be summoned to the user's side with the  [Summoning Jutsu|http://aminoapps.com/p/vsub7t], or even be stored away in a scroll to be released via the [Enclosing Jutsu|http://aminoapps.com/p/2i0o0c].

[Bsc]Description:
[Cs]A human puppet (人傀儡, Hitokugutsu) is a type of puppet created from human corpses, developed by the old Puppet Brigade of Sunagakure in the 2nd great shinobi war. By removing the internal organs of a foe and preserving the body to prevent decomposition, as well as adding weapons and defences, a practitioner of this technique can make powerful human puppets. Despite the name, though traditionally made to look just like themself in life, these puppets don't have to look human at all. These puppets are different from normal ones, as they retain their use of chakra and any kekkei genkai that the human host once had.

[Cs]The stats of the human subject in life convert into stats of a puppet, a weapon, "losing" their Base Traits, but retaining 10% of the subjects DP, EP, OP, ROP, and even ChP, as the puppeteer took great care in meticulously recreating the subjects likeness, selecting between denser, thinner, heavier, and lighter materials and secret mechanisms to imitate what they were in life. Their "HP" is also converted into the puppets base damage, now taking away the life of others...

[Cs]For the puppet to use KKG, it must use the Puppet's own chakra source from their core. If the Puppets Core Chakra is 0, it cannot use it's KKG, until the user spends an action to refill it with their own chakra.

[Bsc]Description:
[Cs]This forbidden technique was developed by a rogue shinobi of sunagakura, a puppeteer of the highest caliber who saught to be one with there art, immortality through their art... The heart of of a living subject is placed within a special, secure container that is is then sealed shut. The practitioner of this technique then seals the chakra, soul, and mind into this core. This core then, when placed within the core of a "[Human Puppet|http://aminoapps.com/p/gxmops]", takes command as their new vessel. 

[Cs]Where as creating a Human Puppet only translates about 10% of their stats in life, this core carries the subjects consciousness and soul along with 90% of their traits, merging with a Human Puppet to create a new 100% living weapon. I.e. the subjects Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Stamina, and Will are all reduced by -10%, this also effects the subjects other stats HP, DP, EP, OP, and ROP. The DP, EP, OP, and ROP of the human puppet is added to the subjects as they merge into one being. This would also allow the host of this core to use any KKG possesed by the Human Puppet it resides in.

[Cs]Alternatively,  this "Puppet Heart | S+" could be crafted into a regular puppet aswell, however, these are lower in their potential power, restricted to regular Puppet limitations and without the benifits of carrying over special abilities from a prior vessel host.

[Cs]The subject of this technique will never again be human, though never truly a puppet either. The subject never again needs to breath, eat, drink, or sleep. The subjects new vessel cannot suffer from Bleeding or Poison except for direct hits to the core, which takes the effects if afflicted. That said, the body too is weak to fire, taking double damage from flame and burns. Only the core may be healed via medical ninjutsu, the bodie's DP must be repaired manually as one would with puppets. Only EP naturally recovers outside of encounters, not DP.

[Bsc]Description:
[SC]These Cursed Seals, or Curse Marks, may only be created by Sages and applied from Sages to non-Sages. By sealing a portion of their own Sage embewed DNA and Chakra over the cararded artery of a willing, or imobile, individual. The trauma of this seal and this process of having these foreign elements merged into one's being removes 90% of their max HP and ChP, forcing them into an unconscious state if taken below 10% HP and below 10% ChP, or kill the target if it takes their HP and ChP to 0%... This portion of locked HP and ChP may only be restored naturally as the mark will repel any attempt at foreign aid.

[Sc]One infected with this seal gains a "Curse Mark" score in their list of Jutsu Scores. At it's core, this seal is a leech, it may potentially offer insurmountable power, but at the cost of one's own health and well-being, harming the user as it feeds off their chakra and the surrounding natural energy in order to produce Sage Chakra as a by product through the Sage's essence. As a consequence,  the side effects of this mark include increased power the more it's fed...

[Sc]If the afflicted has a "Senjutsu Score", half of it adds to their Curse Mark Score. If one attempts to train their Senjutsu score, it grows at half the rate as the parasitic mark feeds off the nature energy that would otherwise be conditioning their own body and chakra. However,  given the nature of this mark, the user gains 1 Senjutsu score for every 2 Curse Mark score points earned. If one were to somehow learn and enter [Sage Mode|http://aminoapps.com/p/in8bnf] , this would erase their Curse Mark and Curse Mark Score.

[Sc]When activating this curse mark, the user's Strength,  Speed, and Stamina increase by a percentage up to half of their "Curse Mark" Score. The same percentage is transfered from their max Chakra Pool into a "Cursed Chakra Pool", (CChP). The user's HP is also reduced by the same amount of converted Chakra Points. This malevolent Cursed Chakra is 50% more potent than regular Chakra, lowering the cost of jutsu when using this chakra, (2CChP instead of 3ChP), and allowing the user to amplify jutsu up to 15 tiers instead of the cap of 10!

[Sc]The mark itself will spread grow and spread accross the user's body in accordance with how much they feed it. Unlike Sage Mode, one afflicted with the curse mark may choose how much of it's power to tap into, for example, one with a CM score of 40 can use up to Curse Mark Stage 1 (20%), or lower, such as CMS1 (1%-19%). Upon reaching a CM Score of 50, the user May enter Curse Mark Stage 2. Any CM score above 50 will not effect stage 1 or stage 2, but may effect certain techniques.

[Sc]The second stage of the Curse Mark increases their Strength,  Speed, and Stamina by 50% and convert 50% of their Max Chakra Pool into their Cursed Chakra Pool, at the cost of HP lost equivalent to converted ChP. Most notably, this stage physically augments the user's body, altering their skin tone and mutating animalistic, or even monsterous traits, (dependent on the summon of the mark giver). This means a Natural Ability shared by the Shōkan of the curse mark giver that may offer increased jumping, digging, climbing, or swimming abilities, etc, and with one Natural Weapon such as a tail, claws, armor, etc.

[Bsc]Description:
[Cs]The Strength of a Hundred Seal is a jutsu from the Sage of Six Paths era that requires extremely delicate chakra control, storing a vast amounts of chakra over an extended period of time into the forehead.

[Cs]Once the seal is formed, the user gains the "Byuakugō" Jutsu Skill, and the user's already impressive chakra control allows them to perform techniques without any wasted energy. This skill is increased by +1 for every 10 Chakra Points stored into this seal. When released, the seal will either spread across the user's face or wrap around their entire body. The stored chakra is then released into their body, greatly amplifying the power of their techniques. 

[Cs]The cost of jutsu cast by this user are reduced by 10%, half of which is stored into this seal into it's own Byakugō Pool of stored chakra. When this seal is activated, the user may determine how far this seal spreads, and what percentage of this pool may be tapped into in increments of 10%.

[Cs]And maximum amount of this pool that the castor may benefit from at a time is equal to the user's max Chakra Pool, which would increase all five of their traits by 100%.

[Cs]The last effect of this technique is possibly it's greatest,  but also most dangerous, and the reason it is a forbidden technique. Traditionally,  a Medical-Nin must follow these four rules;
[S]•1. No medic ninja shall ever stop medical treatment until the lives of their party members have come to an end. 
[S]•2. No medic ninja shall ever stand on the front lines. 
[S]•3. No medic ninja shall ever die until they are the last of their platoon.
[S]•4. Only those medic ninja who have mastered the Strength of a Hundred Technique are permitted to discard the above-mentioned laws.

[SC]When activated, the user heals passively without the active use or concentration of other jutsu, they heal a % of damage taken equal to half of the tier being used, the other half of is removed permanently from the users Max HP, as the forced cell formation reduced the user's life span. This automatically will heal any damaging status effects by 1 Tier per round, including severed limbs if said limb is placed back onto where it belongs on the body. 

[S]*If a user is benifiting from 100% Byakugō, and takes 20 damage, they would automatically heal +10HP, but 10 Max HP would be lost. A Bleeding wound would recover by -1 bleed, a Burn would recover in the same way, however if lit, will continue to be lit, a severed arm, if held to the shoulder, will reattach itself, if knocked prone, the user will still be prone as normal, etc.

[Bsc]Description:
[SC]Kaio-ken (界かい王おう拳けん, Kaiōken, lit. "Realm King Fist")is a technique said to be invented by an ancient Sage, or even god... It is a technique that multiplies the user's ki, or life force, for a "heartbeat" - thus increasing their power and speed and enabling them to inflict serious damage to opponents who are considerably stronger than them. However, the downside of the Kaio-ken is that it takes a heavy toll on the user's body, making them more vulnerable to enemy attacks. While in the state, the user's aura color becomes visible and crimson. The technique requires the use of sage training and masterful Chakra Control and a calm enough mind to handle it, and so cannot be stacked with other more stranuous or berserk states of being.

[Cs]Using this Technique increases the user's Strength, Speed, Will, and natural senses by 10% for a 10 round (60 second) burst, however, once the user leaves this state, their Strength, Speed, Will, and natural senses are temporarily reduced by 5% for 1 hour (60 minutes). The benefits of this technique may be amplified as most other techniques, but so are the drawbacks. As an example,  Kaio-ken ×2 would amplify your abilities by 20% for 1 Minute, , but reduce the same abilities by 10% upon reversion for 2 hours, etc. The usage of Kaio-ken ×10 means almost certain death for most mortals from the cost and drawbacks as their literal life force is being burned away so quickly...

[Cs]Lastly, while in this state, Ninjutsu/Senjutsu may also be amplified by an equivalent boost, so a Kaio-ken ×2 could increase say the effects of a Fireball Jutsu to Fireball Jutsu ×1 by +10%, ×2=+20%, etc, however, the cost would also be increase by an equivalent percentage.

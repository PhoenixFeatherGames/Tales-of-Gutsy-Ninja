[Bc]Description:
[C]An invaluable jutsu, this technique marks an applicable, predetermined substitute with their chakra, leashing it to them in a way, triggering this jutsu swaps places with it to avoid an attack while relocating to a more advantageous location. The instant before they are to be struck by an attack, the user rapidly replaces themselves with an inanimate an object of roughly similar size to themself, such as block of wood or training dummy, that in kind takes their position through their linked chakra signature. The "Substitution" must be marked preemptively for 6 Chakra Points to establish the link, paying the chakra difference when swapping places.

[C]Opponents may briefly believe that they've successfully struck the user, but this is merely an optical illusion, an after image of sorts in tandem with the sound of sound and feeling of truly impacting the substitution, granting them +12EP temporarily, or even OP/ROP under the right circumstances. Opponents will,  however, quickly notice what's happened. This allows the castor to relocate in that instant to distance up to 50% Speed, taking the place of their predetermined substitute. The user can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack, having, for the moment, Half Stealth on their side, or potentially even full Stealth under the right circumstance, allowing them to take this opportunity to attack, hide, or escape...

[Bc]Description:
[C]Chakra Flow (チャクラ流し, Chakura Nagashi) refers to both the flowing of chakra through an object as well as any technique that increases the potency of a weapon by flowing chakra through it. Ordinarily, elemental chakra is used to flow through bladed weapons in order to either, dramatically increase their various pre-existing properties, or to gain additional advantageous effects as it gains qualities of the coated nature. Every additional +5 ChP pumped into this technique per round increases these effects by 50%, (natures that cause "Tier" effects instead have their measurable stats increased by 50%).

[Cu]Basic Nature Releases

[C]Chanelling raw chakra with no added nature will not yield any special effect, but instead allows the user to focus whatever they find their their priority to be at the Time, increasing any stats of their item by +10, but no more than +5 in any single stat. The castor may also use chakra flow in this way to restore the chakra of others.

[C]Wind chakra is used in order to increase the sharpness of bladed weapons, so much so that in the hands of an experienced user even small blades are capable of piercing substantial rocks easily. This effect is achieved by utilising two opposing chakra currents, which are ground against each other in such a manner that they sharpen one another into fine pieces. Chanelling this Wind nature into a weapon increases the Damage and OP/ROP by +7 and adds +1 Sharp/Bleed.

[C]Lightning chakra, as applied to weapons, provides an increased cutting power similar to that of wind, with the addition of inducing numbness. However, this is instead achieved by inducing high-frequency vibrations within the object. This results in increasing the weapons Damage and OP/ROP, by +7, and adds +1 Shock.

[C]Earth chakra seemingly increases the defensive power of an object to its utmost limits, by further reinforcing the inherent properties of the material involved. This Nature increases an object's Damage by +4 and DP by +6.

[C]Water chakra can be applied chanelled to act as a resilient shield of armour thay can withstand many physical attacks, even be passed onto weapons for cleaner, high pressure cuts! The water nature increases an object's Damage and OP by +7 and adds +1 Sharp/Bleed

[C]Fire chakra engulfs the desired weapon in intense localised flames, which follow the subsequent path of the object in question, incinerating anything which comes into direct contact! This burning nature increases Damage by +7 and adds +1 Burn!

[C]Yin Chakra has a very parculiar attribute, dazing the mind, blurring the senses, and numbing struck parts of their body. Each strike reduces the targets EP, DP, OP, and ROP by -5 for one full round! Using Chakra Flow in this manner counts as Genjutsu.

[C]The Yang nature holds it's own unique property aswell, actually repairing organic matter, speeding up the cells generation and natural defenses. This usage of Chakra Flow is most commonly used by Medical Ninja on surgical equipment rather than combat in order to make clean cuts that heal separated tissue, resulting in fewer post operation scars. This heals +7 HP and -1 Bleed OR Burn when held to a wound! Using this method to heal is treated as Iryojutsu. 

[Cu]Advanced Nature Releases

[C]The Explosion nature, as the name entails, allows the user to erupt infused objects in beautiful explosions, fundamentally allowing them to turn anything they touch into bombs on demand. This explosion deals +4 Damage and +1° Burn in a 4 meter area (-4EP to evade). Additionally, regardless of tier, the damage and explosion diameter increase by half of the exploding object's current DP as the shrapnel erupts ain extremely high speed from the sudden burst of energy, however, the object is fully destroyed in the process...

[C]The Steel nature release is has similar properties to Earth, however, instead of hardening the object to its full, Steel pushes past that limit, adding +3 Damage, but +7 DP. This chakra's steel like qualities can not only make things as simple as leaves as durable as metal, but conductive aswell.

[C]The Crystal natured chakra is both delicate and strong, both beautiful and deadly. The crystaline structure of this chakra adds +7 DP, and adds +1Sharp/bleed, imitating one of the sharpest minerals known to man with such rigidity. Even if an object coated in this chakra shatters completely, every peice will still remain razor sharp!

[C]The magnetic nature of Magnet Release will channel 10ib of positively or negatively charged chakra through the castor's medium that may also be transfered from said medium to another target via direct contact. For a Nō clanned shinobi with magnet release, they may use this in conjuction with their other techniques to push or pull subjects to or from one another via opposing or similar charges. The Suna clan may use this as a way to quickly adhere to a medium in 10ib of either Gold or Iron sand respectively without needing their consistent/conscious focus.

[C]Storm Release chakra coats the castors weapon, or other medium,  in a lazer like energy that adds +4 Damage, +4 DP, and +1Burn. A unique property of this energy is its ability to potentially deflect, reflect, or refract energy like bodies that share similar beam like qualities, evenly reducing its energy and stats by -4, destroying the target if reduced to 0, or redirecting it if it goes past 0, its new energy equalling what remained or was carried over.

[C]Swift release, being less of a measurable reflection of an elemental force of nature is instead a force of speed, increasing the velocity of the energized medius as they travel through physical space, adding +5 Damage and OP/ROP.

[C]The Wood nature release chakra is resilient, versitile, and full of life. This chakra adds +3 Damage, +3DP, and absorbs -3 Chakra from direct impact or prolonged contact, if applicable, repairing the medium it is being channeled through by +1 DP if it is damaged.

[C]The Ice Release chakra of the Yuki clan is cold and unforgiving, adding +1 Frostbite via direct impact or prolonged contact with whatever medium this chakra is being channeled through as well as increasing that mediums Damage and DP by +4. Direct contact with said medium can even freeze 1 cubic foot per round of contact of aplicable subjects such as water, ore freeze the medium itself if it contains any liquid to be frozen.

[C]The Dark release chakra, like an bottomless abyss or an ever consuming void, yet it is also a blank, or rather a negative, canvas. Chanelling this chakra through ones weapon, it absorbs -5 ChP via direct impact or prolonged contact with an applicable target, however, once doing so, it takes on the properties of the absorbed chakra, adding half of the chakra's "Chakra Flow" effect, treating this chakra as both Yin's and the absorbed nature's as far as their elemental strengths and weaknesses are concerned. For example, if absorbing Fire natured chakra, this would add +1 Damage and +1° Burn to the ibued medium,  and its strikes would be treated as Yin and Fire chakra nature.

[C]The Light release chakra nature gives light of life to the weilder or to othrers through them, by taking it from others. Thus chakra absorbs 5HP via direct impact or prolonged contact with an aplicable target, able to store up to 10 points of restorituve energy that can heal the weilders HP or others via direct contact, or remove 1 Tier of an injury for -3 points of stored life energy.

[C]The user spits a volley of small fireballs into the air; at a glance, it can appear as though there was only one fireball that then burst into many. The many small flames move wildly through the area, potentially mesmerising targets as they're surrounded. The user controls each individual flame with their chakra, allowing them to guide each at the target and, consequently, making this technique difficult to evade. Users have been known to hide projectiles,  such as Shuriken, within the flames, not only making them more deadly upon impact but also, by controlling the flames' movements, giving users a means of controlling the shuriken as well, doing so requires two half actions however.

[C]Five fireballs, each 1 foot in diameter, are cast by the user to whatever targets they find fit as they are able to partially influence their tragectory with the push and pull of their own chakra! Each fireball deals 3 Damage and causes +1 Burn (Lit). The range and ROP is determined similarly to typical, stackable, ranged projectile volleys,  ((ROP×2)÷# Fireballs)

[C]Every additional 5 Chakra Points pumped into this techniqe, up to the tenth tier, adds an additional Fireball into the volley

[C]Because they have their own chakra, fire clones can perform other jutsu, including making more fire clones. Unlike other clones, these don't just disperse, but rather discharge flame, burning anyone and anything within ROP range when "dispersed", causing the "Burn" status. This flame deals damage equal to the ChP of the clone before being dispersed, dealing +1 Burn and +5ROP per 10 ChP, it's ROP determines how much EP is needed to dodge. Fire clones will also disperse once they or their castor runs out of their ChP or HP. When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user.

Description:
 
The user controls water around their arm pointing it at a target as the target is developed into a intense ball of water! The user must keep their hand touching or inside the ball of water or else it will deactivate. Due to the intense density of the ball it is extremely difficult to get free, and even more so if you cannot breathe under water.

The water prison itself has the following stats <40Dp, 40STR, 3meter in diameter>. While in the water prison if not freed the target will slowly begin to drown, 1/4th "Stamina" determines how many rounds/minutes you can hold your breath. After this, you start taking 10% damage per round. The user can amplify the strength of the Prison by pumping 10 CHP into it, increasing the Dp By +5 and the Str by +5 while also shrinking by 6 inches every increase, as the water gets tighter the target will also take 5 Dmg, ignoring Ep and Dp per increase. This attack can be broken out from while inside however it counts as a grapple, you can not attack the prison from inside. You can also release chakra from your body equal to the cost of the prison to free yourself instantly. While using this Jutsu you cannot attack, if you do the jutsu deactivates instantly.

A relatively powerful technique used to counter any opposing Genjutsu users. With it the castor will appear trapped within a Genjutsu cast upon them before bursting into a large amount of flower petals which then consume the body of the original castor of the genjutsu.

When a Genjutsu is cast at the castor, this technique can be used in retaliation after the initial Genjutsu is evaded with EP. If the castor has a higher Genjutsu or intelligence score by double or more the target is instantly effected, otherwise it will take rounds equal to the castor's int + Genjutsu vs the enemy castor's int + Genjutsu in a sort of grapple to activate this technique. When activated the castor's body will appear to burst into flower petals, these petals will then cover the environment rendering the target half blind, and will then begin to consume the body of the target which causes the target to lose -15 DP per round they are under the genjutsu, gaining a disabled limb per 2 rounds. With every 7chp the damage to DP increases by +5.

They are very versatile and one of the basic ninja tools. They work even under heavy rain. When an healing tag is triggered remotely, ninja need to use a hand seal, requiring two hands.

[C]Contact with the energy from the tag heals those in by +10%/round, and lasts for 1Min(60seconds/10 Rounds), or until removed/destroyed. This is unable to mend status effects or any other ailments. By placing 3 or more tags 1 meter from eachother, in a shape, not a line, this becomes an erea of effect reaching up to a 10m diameter with 10 tags as their healing energies connect. The effect, and chakra cost, is increased by adding more tags, but each tag after the first is only half as effective, and half as chakra costly. This field heals all inside, friend or foe. One who knows this technique may also spend 3oz of ink to disable another's prescription paper and use it as their own.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Explosive Tags (起爆札, Kibaku Fuda), or Paper Bombs, are paper tags inscribed with a special Fuinjutsu text. Infused with chakra, they will explode after a set amount of time, remotely, or after being ignited by flame. The tags can be attached to a surface or wrapped around a weapon to be thrown at an enemy. They are very versatile and one of the basic ninja tools. They work even under heavy rain. When an explosive tag is detonated remotely, ninja need to use a hand seal, requiring two hands.

[C]The explosion from the tag deals 10 Damage, covers 5 meters, worth 5ROP to react to if in range, and also adds +1°Burn(Lit) if directly hit. The effect, and chakra cost, is increased by adding more tags, but each tag after the first is only half as effective, and half as chakra costly. Unlike jutsu, these tags may be repeatilidly stuck together without limit, continuously stacking the effect! One who knows this technique may also spend 3oz of ink to disable another's paper bomb and use it as their own if it has yet to be triggered.

[C]50 Fuinjutsu, must know [Hidden Text Seal|http://aminoapps.com/p/isqodu]
[Bc]Cost:
[C]1oz Castor Blood, 15 Chakra Points
[Bc]Description:
[C]The Summoning Technique allows the user to summon a contracted Summon, typically [Shōkan|http://aminoapps.com/p/4x8fdb] , but occasionally rare and unique/atypical creatures , to their location. Before an animal can be summoned, a prospective summoner must first form a contract with the animal and/or it's species. 

[C]Attempting to summon an animal without first signing a contract will summon a Shōkan animal of a species they have a natural affinity for, however, this summon, not being under any formal contract,  is under no obligation to assist the summoner and more than likely "Reverse Summon" themself home, or worse, may attack. This will also require 10oz of blood, and an entire turn to write. This tends to be the most common way of forming contracts, but also quite risky, as the Shōkan must be willing to test you, only forming a contract if impressed,  and assuming the shinobi doesn't die... Alternatively,  one who has signed a contract may allow their pupil to the contract for their summons. The contract is an XXL Scroll thst mainly stays with the Shōkan leader, but one who is contracted may borrow it to let their pupil sign, but once signed, it returns. A contracted shinobi may also be summoned by their Shōkan.

[C]When using this technique without a contract, the user must spend a turn to write out the summoning formula with 10 ounces of their own blood. With a contract, you simply need to place 1oz of your own blood on your palm and slam it against a surface, your blood will spread to form the proper summoning seal itself as you pump your chakra into it.

[C]For every 15ChP poured into the summon, the castor may summon an additional Shōkan NPC worth 50 EXP, or a single summon of equivalent EXP. For example,  a shinobi can summon two D-Rank Shōkan worth 50 EXP, or 1 C-Rank Shokan worth 100 EXP. The summoner cannot summon Shōkan worth more EXP than their own potential, to a maximum of 600, being the Shōkan's leader. One can not summon while summoned. 

[C]A Shōkan will not fight to the death, "Reverse Summoning" itself home if reduced to 10% or lower health and or chakra. All Shōkan will know "[Reverse Summoning Technique|http://aminoapps.com/p/9tiwjhn]" regardless of rank. C-Rank and up will also know "Summoning" technique. 

*These summons can be NPC's made by leaders or by players and approved by leaders. Players can even summon Shōkan made by other players or leaders as long as they have a contract for that species. All Shōkan know Summoning and Reverse Summoning Jutsu.

[Bc]Cost:
[C]1oz Castor Blood, 15 Chakra Points
[Bc]Description:
[C]Like the standard Summoning Technique, this technique allows the user to transport a target to a location. But whereas the summoning jutsu brings the contracted to the castor, the reverse summoning technique carries the castor to the contracted, or returns the summoned to their previous location prior to being summoned. 

[C]In essense, this allows summon to travel to the contracted shinobi, or return to their previous location after being summoned. Likewise,  this allows shinobi to travel to their contracted summon's location, including a [Shōkan's|http://aminoapps.com/p/4x8fdb] homeland, or return home if summoned to the summons location/Shōkan's homeland. 

[C]If one attempts to use this jutsu prior to forming a contract with a  Shōkan, this will require 10oz of blood, 100ChP, and a whole turn to write, then take them to the homeland of whatever Shōkan they have a natural affinity for, however, Shōkan, not being under any formal contract, are under no obligation to assist the summoner and more than likely "Reverse Summon" them home, or worse, may attack the unwanted intruder. That said, there have been cases of contracts formed this way, if the Shōkan are willing to test the shinobi, and find themselves impressed...

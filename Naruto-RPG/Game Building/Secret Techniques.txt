[Bc]Description:
[C]The Shadow Imitation Technique, sometimes called the shadow possession technique, is the signature technique of the Nara clan. The user manipulates their shadow across a surface to merge it with a target or targets' shadow. The user can stretch their shadow however they wish, up to a distance of meters equal to their ROP+"Deer Shadow",  in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area, meaning that if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it. But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range, such as creating a flash of light to briefly extend their own shadow or to extend his targets', doubling the effective range. The user may also connect their shadow to another shadow, allowing them to extend the range by +50%, but reducing this extention by 10% per connected shadow. The user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in complete darkness.

[C]Once a user merges their shadow with a target's, the castor may restrain the target, rendering them unable to move on their own other than to talk. The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand, etc. The user may also connect their shados to a target, either willingly or without their knowledge,  waiting for them to move closer to another target before restricting connected parties. Doing so may double the shadows base reach.

[C]Controlling the targets body is treated as a grapple of the target's Str vs the castor's Sta+"Deer Shadow". The user may take hold of multiple targets at once if they are in range to be connected by the shadows, but the user mist grapple with the strength of all trapped parties. If the target or user are forcibly moved while connected, this will still refect onto both parties.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Partial Expansion is one of the unique hijutsu techniques of the Akimichi clan where the user increases the size of only specific body parts, typically the arms and legs. Because of the larger size, physical attacks made with the expanded limbs do greater damage than normal aswell as show to be more durable. 

[C]If you use this ability on a limb, it will double it's size! Increasing it's size by 100% will increase your strength with that arm by 50% and give you +25% temp DP when using the limb to block attacks!

[C]You may also use this ability on your torso aswell, but it will make your torso round like a ball, which makes movement difficult, halving your land speed, OP, and ROP unless using the "[Human Boulder Technique|http://aminoapps.com/p/ssoflog]".

[Bc]Cost:
[C]1 Chakra Points per 1 Meter Voice Thrown
[Bc]Description:
[C]Ventriloquism is an act of stagecraft in which a person (a ventriloquist) speaks in such a way that it looks like their voice is coming from a different location, usually through a puppet known as a "dummy". The act of ventriloquism is ventriloquizing, and the ability to do so is commonly called in E the ability to "throw" one's voice.

[C]The term "throwing your voice" is a misconception about traditional ventriloquism however, as the voice always comes from the ventriloquist. However, a skilled ventriloquist can make it sound like their voice is coming from far away by varying its modulation and level in volume and pitch. 

[C]Members of the Chikimatsu clan take this one step further however by incorporating their shinobi techniques,  capable of literally carrying their voice from one point to release in another by simply molding the chakra through their mouth as they form their words!  

[C]Of course, they pick up the traditional practice aswell when learning this technique, able to "throw" their voice 1 foot away for every 10 points in their Kugujutsu score without using any chakra at all, adding this traditional form's distance aswell to  the total distance of this technique!

[C]Typically, this may used in conjunction with their "Puppet Technique" to give the illusion that the puppet itself is the one speaking, while keeping their true position hidden from view, however this may also be cleverly employed as misdirection to trick one into looking the otherway to the sound of your voice as you make a clean getaway, or use this moment of distraction to make a half stealth attack, assuming the target is not smart enough to catch wise... Other potential uses may vary far or few, limited inly by the performer's own creativity!

[Bc]Cost:
[C]2 Chakra Points per thread per minute
[Bc]Description:
[C]The Puppet Technique is the core skill of a puppeteer's fighting style, whereby they control a weaponized puppet. Performing the Puppet Technique involves emitting chakra threads from a user's fingers to connect to a puppet, with the fingers' movements controlling the puppet's actions. Less experienced users will connect all ten of their fingers to a single puppet, with each finger controlling a specific joint or mechanism. As a user becomes more experienced they require fewer threads to control a single puppet, until finally they can control a puppet using only one thread. With this growing mastery, users also become able to control multiple puppets at a time. 

[C]A puppet made out of anything other than wood costs twice as much to wield, and if these threads are used on unwilling  people, treat them as a "Stunned", (able to be forcebly moved at half speed), using 10% of Puppeteer's ROP per thread vs their target's Strength to break free, as if they were grappled. The furthest a puppet may be from its wielder is equal to the wielders own ROP. A puppets total OP is equal to it's own OP, (if any), plus the user's ROP. The total melee attack of a puppet would deal damage equal to half of the user's ROP, plus any additional damage the puppet may have. 

[C]Newer puppeteers may control one XL Sized Puppet, or XL Puppet Part, about 2 meters in size, at a time, requiring 10 threads to maneuver. For reference,  an XXL sized puppet is about 4 meters in size; XL=2m, 10 threads; L= 1m, 8 Threads; Sm= 1'6", 6 Threads; T= 9", 4 Threads.

[C]For every 10 points in their Kugutsu Score, they require one less thread to navigate their marionettes, (minimum 1 thread needed), and become capable of weilding XXL Puppets with 10 threads once they reach a Kugutsu Skill of 20. This pattern could in theory continue, but humans only have 10 fingers...

[C]At it's lowest level, this covers a 2m×2m×2m area, needing +8ROP if in range to attempt evading. This treats anyone inside as hidden and blinded, and causing +1 Burn(Acid) per round inside this cloud, which lasts 3 rounds, and also causes Suffication unless those inside can hold theor breath long enough...

[Bc]Cost:
[C]9% Total ChP and 1g of Ash
[Bc]Description:
[C]The user molds their fire chakra, together with the ash within their own lungs, to form into one or several identical clones. Unlike regular clones, ones generated by this method do not just disappear when struck with sufficient force, but rather burn the surounding area and leave a fog of blinding ash.

[C]Ash Clones stats are 10% that of the origional castors stats and are able to cast any jutsu of the summoner. Unlike the basic Clone Technique, ash clones are physically real. They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation. Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created, but complicated technology or effects won't be duplicated. Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, fire clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by dōjutsu other than the Byakugan, Mangekyo Sharingan, or presumably, the Rinnegan or Tenseigan. 

[C]Because they have their own chakra, ash clones can perform other jutsu, including making more ash clones. Unlike other clones, these don't just disperse, but rather discharge hot ash, burning anyone and anything within ROP range when "dispersed", causing the "Burn" status. This cloud deals damage equal to half the ChP of the clone before being dispersed, dealing +1 Burn and +10ROP +1 Round per 10 ChP, it's ROP determines how much EP is needed to dodge aswell as the diameter of it's blackened fog, which remains for one round, temporarily blinding any within it's area of effect while also granting those within stealth coverage. Ash clones will also disperse once they or their castor runs out of their ChP or HP. When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user.

The burning ashes crash through the target, dealing significant physical damage, and burns, as well as a blinding shroud of ashen debris. The more talented the user, the greater the amount of ash that the dragon can be made from ash produced.

[C]This fierce pyre has a diameter of 3 meters, and can stretch out up to 15 meters in length! The sheer force of impact from this beast deals 20 damage, +1 Burn(Acid), and easily knock prone any unable to evade the user's ROP +15, as well as leaving a similarly sized trail of ashen cloud in place of its body upon being dispelled, or a 20m Diameter cloud of burning ash upon crashing into a solid area instead, that also obscures extra sensory abilities from the chakra infused ash and takes 6 seconds to settle, causing +1°Burn(Acid) per round and Temporary Blindness, as well as offering Half Stealth, to those inside. For each additional 15ChP, a skilled castor may increase the size by 2 meter in width and 3 meters in length, increasing the Damage by +10, +1 Burn(Acid), ROP by +5, and increasing the Diameter of the ashen cover by +6m, lasting an additional 6 seconds.

[Bc]Description:
[C]The Mind Body Switch Technique is the signature technique of the Yamanaka clan. The user converts their consciousness to spiritual energy, which they send at a target. Their consciousness moves slowly towards the target and travels in a straight line reaching meters equal to the castor's ROP+"Boar Mind". If the user misses their target, it will take several minutes for their consciousness to find its way back to their own body.

[C]The user converts their consciousness to spiritual energy with their chakra, which they may then project into a living targets mind. If the user misses their target, it will take 1 minute per meter away for their consciousness to find its way back to their own body. When their consciousness does successfully make it to the target, the user supplants the target's mind and takes total control of their body.

[C]When hijacking anothers body, the user's collapses. Controlling the body is treated as a grapple of the target's Will vs the castor's Will+"Boar Mind". Any damage sustained to the posessed body will reflect on the user's own origional body. If the user willingly releases this ability, they will instantly return to their own. If the user is forced out, it will rake rounds equal to meters away from their body to return to it.

This is most often used after growing in size with the Multi-Size/Expansion Technique, or even the " [Partial Expansion|http://aminoapps.com/p/rmp0lt]" jutsu when expqnding their torso, the Akimichi tucks themselves into a ball and rolls towards a target. Due to their increased weight and the force of their rotation, most obstacles are pulverised upon contact. However,  
the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction.

[C]When using this ability, the user's full strength score deals damage instead of half since they are using the propelled force of their entire body! Given some mobile limitations, and the use of the body as a charging weapon, the user uses ROP instead of OP when atraching with this technique.

[Bc]Cost:

[Bc]Description:
[C]The Gentle Fist is a form of hand-to-hand combat used by members of the Hyūga clan. It inflicts internal damage through attacking the body's Chakra Pathway System, subsequently injuring organs which are closely intertwined with the area of the network which has been struck. To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own chakra into the opponent's chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system. Even the slightest tap can cause severe internal damage, hence the name "gentle" fist. Doing this, a Sōke Hyūga deals an extra +4 damage to the target each successful blow, but a Bunke clan member deals an extra +8 damage per blow!

[C]By employing the use of the Byakugan they can target the tenketsu, thus enhancing the havoc and control a Gentle Fist practitioner can impose upon an opponent's chakra network. These 361 nodes are key gate-keeping interceptions in the chakra circulatory network, thus forcibly opening or sealing them in whatever manner the Gentle Fist user sees fit, but damaging their HP regardless. Doing this, a Sōke Hyūga may reduce or raise 4ChP of the targets current and max Chakra Pool per successful blow, locking 4ChP of the Max Pool per point blocked. Bunke clan members are able to raise or reduce and lock 8ChP per blow.

[Bc]Cost:

[Bc]Description:
[C]This is a secret taijutsu of the Hyūga clan. Using their Byakugan's near-360° field of vision, the Hyūga envisions themselves within the centre of an Eight Trigrams symbol. The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu. Those sixty-four tenketsu are subsequently blocked, stopping the flow of chakra within the target's body following the same rules as the "[Gentle Fist|http://aminoapps.com/p/zcetol]", making it difficult for them to move. Alternatively, the sixty-four strikes can be split amongst multiple targets, such as to to deflect incoming projectiles. The highest and by far most difficult form of this ability is composed of 128 consecutive strikes!

[C]The total number of strikes are broken into six smaller sets. Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster. As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks. If the first strike of any set is countered, the technique is ended, though the chakra cost is accounted for at the beginning of each set. If a set successfully, fully lands without any hit being countered, you make continue to the next set. The six sets of strikes are;

•First, two consecutive strikes to make two. This is treated as a dual action, halving the melee damage and OP of each strike to any target within range.

•Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four. The melee damage of each strike deals 1/4th melee damage, and 1/4 OP to any target within range.

•Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight. The melee damage of each strike deals 1/8th melee damage, and 1/8 OP to any target within range.

•Fourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen. The melee damage of each strike deals 1/15th melee damage, and 1/15th OP to any target within range.

•Fifth, sixteen consecutive strikes to make thirty-two. The melee damage of each strike deals 1/30th melee damage, and 1/30th OP to any target within range.

•Sixth, thirty two consecutive strikes to make sixty-four. The melee damage of each strike deals 1/50th melee damage, and 1/50th OP to any target within range.

•Seventh, another sixty four consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of one hundred and twenty-eight strikes. The melee damage of each strike deals 1/100th melee damage, and 1/100th OP to any target within range.

They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin. The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled. Revolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hyūga's Byakugan.

[C]This round defensive wall of pure chakra has a radius of 4 meters, (8 Meter diameter), centered on the castor,  and provides 32 Temporary DP and anything that makes contact with this wall, that is unable to break through, is flung back with a strength of 16! Meaning a projectile could be flung back to sender with a +8 to damage, or if one were to physically make contact, they would suffer 16 damage and be thrown back 8 meters and knocked prone! This is all doubled for Bunke Hyūga of the branch family.

[C]Shortly after a member of the Aburame clan is born, hundreds insects are allowed to colonise his or her body. In exchange for getting to feed off of their host's chakra, the insects follow the host's every command, from attack to defence to reconnaissance, and everything in between. The insects inevitably become the core ability of the Aburame's entire fighting style. The reach of these insects are limited to the user's Will in meters, but any attack they make uses the host's ROP, dependent on their direction and instruction, communicated silently through chakra and pharamones.

[C]Even though Aburame can potentially host thousands of insects in their body at a time, an unspoken contract, and limited body space, restricts how many they may host. For every 2 chakra points sacrificed from their total chakra pool, they add 1 slot to their unique insect pool called their "Hive". With every 10 Konchūjutsu Score Points, they may crossbreed another type of insect into their Hive. They may refill a number of insect swarms equal to their Konchūjutsu Score per day.

[C]The size of the insects play a major roll aswell,  requiring the usage of swarms at a time for the smaller spiecies to make any significant impact, as the smaller breeds have lower stats and require larger numbers per swarm to fill a hive slot, only for the swarms to get larger but individual units to get stronger as the size of the breed increases.

[C]XXT Insects have <0.0005 Stats per>, each Insect Swarm taking 1 Hive Slots, and have a minimum of 10,000 insects per breed per swarm. From this point, XT Insects <0.005 Stats per> may be bred, each Swarm worth a 1 hive slots but requiring 1,000/Swarm. Every increasing size bred larger than size Small take an additional slot and grow significantly in power and size, growing the stats of the individual insect ×10, but reducing the swarm size by ÷10 per size increase, still just filling 1 Hive Slot. This patter continues until  Medium Insects <5 Stats per>, where a "Swarm" consists of a single unit, and although it fills 1 Hive Slot, it no longer can fit inside the host's body. Every size after this doubles the stats and Hive Slots required  by the size before, a single unit being considered a swarm. Any swarms of insects residing outside of the hosts body or stored in containers must be have contact with the Aburame for at least 1 hour a day in order to properly share chakra and communicate with their Hive.

*An example of how this may be tracked in ones inventory, rather than:
 •(1,000)Rinkaichū <XT, 0.001Dmg, 0.001DP, +0.001%Bleed> | D-
Could be:
•Rinkaichū Swarm <XT, 1Dmg, 1DP, +1%Bleed> | D-

[Bc]Cost:
[C]12 Chakra Points per Minute
[Bc]Description:
[C]Unique to Samurai, this technique employs the concept of chakra flow and shaping. Through the use of chakra flow, the user channels their chakra through their swords, extending both the reach and cutting ability of the blade, while allowing the user to fire crescents of chakra whenever the blade is swung. This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles may completely penetrate stone pillars, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings. The samurai also have the ability to use shape transformation during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords, spiked shafts and even axes. This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of wakizashi, while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary. This transformational quality extends to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles able to replicate the appearanceand shape of , the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.

[C]Simply put, as many chakra points as you put into your weapon, you get an equivalent amount of stat points added onto it, for example, if a Samurai had a Wakizashi <§, +8Dmg, +18DP> | A, they could channel 15ChP per minute in order to chakra cloak their blade to a size more akeen to a Katana, <§, +14Dmg, +24DP>,  and increase the length of it's reach by 1 foot, but these 12 stat points may be distributed how the Samurai see fit for the circumstance! For each aditional 6ChP channeled,  this is increased by +6Stat Points and +1ft. Likewise, the Samurai may also focus that chakra to immitate the shape and properties of other weapons, such as axes, or hammers.

[C]When using this technique in a ranged fashion, flinging the cloak from ones weapon to form a projectile, the DP converting to ROP, and the added length increasing the projectile's size instead of increasing the weapons reach. The casotr may shape this projectile as they please, giving it more of a giant buzzsaw, or divy up the energy into multiple, smaller, projectiles. Of course regardless of usage, the released energy will ultimately dissipate after reaching it's max range.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Unique to Samurai, this technique employs the concept of chakra flow and shaping, while also adding elemenral nature into the mold! Just like this technique's precurser, this shapes chakra around the user's blade, while also being able to channel one's Elemental Nature into the mix, offering unique properties to their swords and offering further versatility! 

[C]Functionally, this opperates the same way as it's predecessor, although the cost and effect is twice that of before, aswell as each nature offering an additional effect. These effects may be increased by +12 Stat Points and +1ft in size for each aditional 12ChP channeled into the weapons chakra cloak.

•Just Chaneling raw chakra with no nature simply grants the castor the +24 default Stat Points to distribute as they shape their weapons cloak of Chakra,  but also adds +1 to the weapons Dmg, DP, OP, and ROP per tier.

•Fire Natured Chakra adds +1° Burn per tier.

•Wind Natured Chakra adds +4OP/ROP per Tier.

•Lightning Natured Chakra adds +1 Shock per Tier.

•Earth Natured Chakra increases DP by +4 per Tier, only half of which is converted from DP to ROP if formed into a projectile, however will remain tangible if launched in this manner until it's remaining time is out.

•Water Natured Chakra adds +1 Bleed per Tier.

•Yin Natured Chakra bypasses DP not enhanced with chakra, unable to harm or be stopped DP, but only the stats of the cloak.

•Yang Natured Chakra may be applied to a target, enveloping them in a healing aura that passivley restores +1% HP per tier per round for it's remaining time when cast, (healing 10%HP per round for 10 rounds at T10).

[Bc]Description:
[C]All jinchūriki are able to use certain abilities granted to them by their tailed beasts. As they get older and they gain (or lose, as the case may be) control over their tailed beast's power, they are also able to transform into their tailed beast to varying degrees, granting them capabilities increasingly closer to the tailed beast itself.

[C]By simply tapping into their beast's chakra, a jinchūriki begins their initial transformation. They are surrounded by a layer of red, wispy chakra granting them enhanced Strength, Intellegence, Stamina, Speed, and Will. In this form, the jinchūriki's body undergoes slight physical changes, such as growing, spiking hair, eyes that shift to match that of their Bijū's, and sharpened teeth and claws. This intense, forign chakra leaking out from their pours is hard on the user's body however, dealing 1% Burn(Unlit) damage every round active, however it is not just them, causing +1 Burn(Unlit) to whomever they make direct physicalcontact with, or to whom ever touch them.

[C]For every percent of power being drawn from their Bujū, the user gains +1% of the Biju's Natural Weapons and Natural Abilities. The amount of power being drawn from is visually represented by the amount of chakra tails the cloak is showing. This can be determined via dividing 100 by the number of tails the actual beast has and rounding down. At each point, a new tail will emerge from the cloak, as it's chakra thickens and intensifies.

[C]When the Bijutsu Score reaches 50, the Host may fight with all of their tails out, adding a total of 50% of their Bijūs power to their own, or, they may instead let their Bijū take the drivers seat, growing into it's full form and adding 50% of their Stats to their Bijū! Any score after this will have no effect until a Bijutsu Score of 100. However, to be able to do this, the host must first confront their inner turmoil within their own mind scape, for if they cannot find peace within themself, they shall lose themself by giving so much control to their sealed beast. Failing this conflict will reverse the seal, putting the Bijū in full control as the new host.

However, to earn this level of trust,  obedience, to open a free flow of chakra between the host and their Bijū, they must first confront their beast directly, merging their mind scape with their seal, unlocking their beasts metaphysical cage, and defeating them head on to assert their will fully as leader, or master. Failing in this will fully release the seal, destroying the bond tethering the two beings as one, releasing the Bijū from their vessel, leading the prior host to die in the process ...

[Cs]The final form of this cloak, it's ultimate potential, it's last resort... In a process similar to nuclear fusion, the Jinchūriki's and Bijū's max chakra are consumed as raw materials to produce a new type of energy, energy as potent Ōtsutsuki's or the Jūbi's Godly Chakra, draining their own lifespanin the process. The most terrifying aspect however stems from the fact that because all chakra is connected, contact with an opponent will drain their lifespan as well. 

[Cs]As powerful as Baryon Mode is, it is extremely dangerous if used for too long or recklessly, and only achievable with a Jinchuriki score if 200+. Doing so will gradually drain at the user's strength and very lifespan. Because of the extreme risk, the user must not make any unnecessary movements, nor act on any stray thoughts, focusing on only the most calculated of moves to keep Baryon Mode stable. Even more, over-usage of this form comes at an even greater risk of the Bijū's life altogether, effectively killing them, taking years before their chakra may reform in the world. However, if the Bijū dies in this way, the host will not lose their lufe as per normal extraction,  however, their Bijutsu Score will be ereased.

[Cs]In this form, the users chakra is divided by 3 and added to their JChP, which is then divided by 2, becoming a Baryon Pool. If this BP hits 0, The Bijū will fade away. Any health lost from the user is subtracted from their Max HP, however, any damage the user deals via melee is removed from the target's Max HP. The user's stats are double that of their Perfect JCM, but their Max HP and BP is reduced by 10% each round, lasting 10 rounds, or 1 minute...

Description:
 
Tailed Beast Balls are made from an 8:2 ratio of positive black chakra and negative white chakra. Users must gather and balance this chakra in their mouths, shape it into a sphere and then fire it at their target. Most users fire their Tailed Beast Balls as-is, while others may consume the ball and fire it from their mouth as a beam, focusing the attack on a narrower area instead of letting it detonate all around upon impact, or hace even shown doing something in between, not consuming its Tailed Beast Ball, but biting it and firing it out in a wave. Tailed Beasts and or Jinchūriki can also combine their Tailed Beast Balls to form it into larger ones.

Tailed Beast Balls are incredibly dense, so much so that despite being suspended in the air, they instantly crater the ground beneath the user due to their extreme weight.Despite how heavy they are, they move at an incredible rate once fired and are very destructive, creating explosions that are visible from incredibly far away and that vaporize almost everything in the blast area. The extent of the damage is dependent upon how the ball is fired and how much chakra it has. 

Its standard, first tier state is 3' in size, lauching out 30 meters, erupting and causing a T3 Burn(Unlit) and dealing 90 damage to everything within a 3 meter diameter, <90 Damage, +3° Burn(Unlit), 3' Bomb, 3m AOE, +30 ROP>. Every additional 15BChP, (5JChP), fed into this technique increase the Bomb's size by +2' and it's AOE by +2m, its damage and Rop by +30, and its Burn(Unlit) by +2°.

Description:
 
A Tailed Beast uses its massive reserves of raw energy to amplify their roar into a powerful force of pressure and destruction that unleash around them. These shockwaves could vary from deflecting simple projectiles or even ninjutsu, to leveling entire villages.

When performed the castor sends out a shockwave that has an outward pushing Strength equal to their Will. This extends outward in All directions centered at the castor's mouth with a diameter equal to their Will, or a radius of ½Will. Subjects that attempt to oppose this force, if able, reduce its effect by their own Strength, otherwise finding themselves launched twice the remaining distance and height, up and away.

Other than the concern for potential damage from the fall, they will also take damage equal to the castor's Will, reduced by the subjects Strength (if they were capable of resisting any of the force), if anything obstacles such as a walls or trees or even other beings stand in the way between them and their end destination. This damage is shared to the obstacle as well. If hit directly, the target is also temporarily deafened for 1 round, or temporarily half deafened for one round if the force is resisted, as one cannot Defend against the force. One is only safe by evading entirely, as this wave of pressure has its own ROP equal to half the Will of the castor to even react to it, and even then, the would-be casualties would still need to get out of its way.

The Damage of incoming Projectiles is reduced by the strength of this force, launching back to the sender if by the force difference if the shockwave is more powerful, or dispelling the projectile if not physical or solid, like ninjutsu such as a fireball. With every 3BChP or 1JChP the shockwave gains an extra +10 strength +10m Distance,  and +10 ROP.

A tailed beast swipes their chakra infused claws through the air, causing a twister to form which wreaks havoc upon unsuspecting foes who view it as just a simple melee attack. It’s dangers lie in the fact that if a target is caught within the twister they may remain trapped and become eviscerated  by the high speed shrapnel and debris within.

This twister that stands 21 meters tall, and 6 meters wide in diameter travels foward 1 meter per second, (6m/round), up to the user’s ROP in meters. The Current strength of this violent vortex is directly proportional to its DP, starting at 20.

Anything and anyone is caught in the twister will be  grappled by it as they are spun within the twister. And carried away with it for and shot out towards the ground, landing prone regardless of the height. With every round spent within the twister targets gain a tier of bleed as the winds and debris cut them up, being thrown out as the twister reaches the end of it’s journey  from the top!

With every 9 BChP or 3JChP, the twister gains +1 meters in height,  +1 meter in diameter, and gains a +5 in it’s strength score.

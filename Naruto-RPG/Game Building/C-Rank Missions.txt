[Bc]Mission:
[C]I don't believe in "Cages" or keeping natures most beutiful creature trapped in captivity, so that is why I keep the precious fur babies I breed in the fenced off enclosure of The Forest of Death! I almost only ever sell them to Konoha because I know how happy and safe they can be of course! However,  someone must have left a gate open somewhere, because my THREE White Tigers have gone missing, lost outside of the village walls! I would track them and gingerly bring them home myself, because they love me of course as much as I love them, but my dear husband has also vanished recently, and I fear the worst and am not in the proper emotional state!

[C]I am hiring you to capture them so they may be returned, ALIVE and in one piece! If you cut or tear them apart or kill any of them, YOU will be the one paying and I doubt you could afford it! They are hard to miss, all standing 2 meters (6') on all fours!

*Tiger stats below.
*Ryō will be reduced by 20% for any disability inflicted, and reduced by 50% for any tiger killed. Any negative ryō will be payed by the mission taker.
*Burn, Bleed, and Poison 9 or below are acceptable.  Fur can regrow and hide cuts, and they can still be treated with medical care.

[Bc]Mission:
[C]Over time, our village has expanded bit by bit in many different ways than just expanding our walls. Some argue this could to be related to the increase if wildlife to our boarder. In particular, multiple reports of a wolf pack attacking anyone passing through the near by woodlands. This pack consists of three wolves about 1 meter standing on all fours, and one that stands at anout 3 meters (9')!.

[C]You are to find this pack and irradicate them. Alternatively, if are able to subdue them relatively unharmed, we may add them to our own Forest of Death and compensate you for their donation. 

*Wolf Stats below.
*The mission taker will be rewarded an additional +5% ryō for each wolf not killed, (10% if alive and not crippled). +10% not crippled or killed, (20% if alive and not crippled), for the alpha.

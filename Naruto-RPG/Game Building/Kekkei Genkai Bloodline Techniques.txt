[C]1 Max Chakra Points per 1 Pound of Sand
[Bc]Description 
[C]Sand Manipulation, as the name implies, is the manipulation of it within the relative vicinity. It is both offensive and defensive styled, augmented for making long, mid, and close ranged attacks, weapons, and armor molded by the grains! Only jinchūriki, past and present, of the Ichibi, or the One-Tailed Beast themself, are capable of manipulating actual sand of the desert and earth to the extent that they could be considered a native user of the nature itself. Attempts to replicate it however have yielded with the Immitation of the kekkei genkai,  [Magnet Realease|http://aminoapps.com/p/nglytx], which focuses on manipulating magnetic minerals, such as Iron and Gold by the Suna Clan of the sand village.

[C]User's of this technique may infuse 1 Chakra Point from their Max Chakra Pool per pound. These shavings may manipulated in shape at will! If the dust is "Destroyed", The user's max ChP is unlocked, but, by reinserting the equivilent ChP from their max Chakra Pool as an action, they may once again take control of the metalic residue. The reach and ability to hit with their power is equal to half of their "Will" stat. The stats of these differing materials are as follows:

•Satetsu: Iron Sand can be used to create up to 1 Damage per pound and 2 DP per pound. Users can grind down a half rank of metal into a pound of Iron Sand, destroying it, or buy the iron Sand from the Shop. They also start with "(1ib)Iron Dust | D-" in their inventory.

•Sakin: Gold Dust, being a heavier yet softer metal per square inch, can be used to create up to 2 Damage and 1 DP per pound. Users can grind down 1,000 Ryo to make a pound of Gold Dust, destroying the coins, or buy the Gold Dust from the Shop. They start off already possessing "(1ib)Gold Dust | D-" in their inventory.

•Suna: Sand from the earth can be used to create up to 1 Damage per pound and 1 DP per pound. Users can imbue their chakra into the surrounding earth, practically offering unlimited reserves of supply for their stock with no financial cost or expense. Sand is represented in the inventory of these users as  "(1ib)Sand | E".

[C]1ib of Infused Sand per 1 HP of Clone
[Bc]Description:
[C]Unlike other clone techniques, the sand clone's composition is usually obvious at all times, only taking the castor's basic form, but not their exact appearance. Because of this, the clone can be reverted to sand at any time, most often when being attacked; as it's punched or kicked, the castor can use the clone's sand to immediately capture the opponent's limbs. Alternatively, one could use the clone as a decoy, drawing opponents to it and once they're close enough, manipulating the clone's sand against them. Whereas other clones can only take so much damage before being destroyed, users of this technique can reform the sand clone regardless of what happens to it... 

[C]The clone's stats are 10% of the user, requiring 1 pound of the users own chakra infused sand per Health Point of the clone. As these clon'es HP reduces, the pounds of sand are also destroyed, requiring the castor to re-instill chakra into the sand as they would normally if their dust's DP is broken apart. However, unique to these clone's are the ability to repair themselves with more of the castor's chakra infused grains, restoring 1HP per pound replaced on their body!

[C]Like normal clones, these can perform all the same technique's as the castor, even manipulate their sand, including the sand formong their own bodies! However, if these clones expend chakra for jutsu, it comes from the sand that formed them, because these clones do not have their own chakra pool, instead spending their own HP in place of ChP.

[C]Lastly, the matter used to form the clone also effects the properties of the clone! Iron Sand will increase the clone's DP by 66%, Gold Dust will increase the clone's Melee Damage by 66%, and Earth Sand increase both by 33%. A maximum of 10 of these clones may be formed at any one time by a single castor.

Description:
 
 The user uses sand to create a platform capable of supporting their weight, which is suspended in the air with their chakra. One of the simpler purposes for this technique is as a defence, lifting the user out of reach of attacks. While airborne, the user can still use other techniques, such as forming his Shield of Sand around the platform for additional protection. This technique can also be used for transportation, enabling the user to travel around quickly. Platforms can be made larger to support allies, or the user can give allies their own platforms.

This levitating, T1, structure is formed by 10ib of sand and capable of carrying roughly 1 person and their possessions, or 200ib of weight. This platform is capable of manuvering freely in a three-dimensional space with a flying speed of 10. Every 5 pounds, up to +45ib at T10, of sand added to this construct increase the carrying weight by 100ib or an additional person with an increased +5 Flying Speed.

One may create up to 10 T1 platforms,  but they must stay within reach of the castors control. Alternatively,  one may make multiple platforms of different sizes, but the tiers stack and cap at T10 from any combination of platforms and or sizes. 

Sand of the platform may still be used normally,  but may not be removed from the platform. Every pound of sand removed or destroyed reduces the flight speed by -2. Starting from the first pound over, every 20 pounds of weight over the platforms limit also decreases the flight speed by -2. The user may always use there sand to repair their platforms when able as well.

[C]10 Chakra Point per 10ib Force
[Bc]Description:
[C]Through the Magnet Release nature, the user is able to magnetise anything they touch as well as themselves, and then subsequently, anything that touches something they have already magnetised, and so on. However, the magnetic force weakens from object to object. Once a person has been magnetised, the user can manipulate the magnetic field in such a manner as to make any subsequent attack using a magnatized weapon practically impossible to evade.

[C]The castor may control whether the magnetic field they place upon themselves or of what they touch is of a +Positive (North) or a -Negative (South) polarity. The user may only remove the charge or change the polarity of said charge of a field by directly coming into contact with it. Whenever anything or anyone, besides the castor unless they will it, comes into contact with these fields, the Magnetic Force is evenly distributed  between these subjects.

[C]Opposite magnetic forces attract, pulling towards eachother, where as the same polarities will push away from eachother. At it's most basic effect, T1, this field reaches out in a 1 meter diameter centered on the magnetised subject. The pushing and pulling strength is treated as 10, so if the total magnetic force between the two subjects is 10ib, adding +10 melee Damage and +10(R)OP to attracted fields within range, or reducing incoming Melee Damage and (R)OP from opposing fields within range by -10. The total added or reduced effect is determined by the total #ib of magnetic force between the effected bodies. 

[C]The user may also increase the Damage and ROP of their own projectiles by charging them opposite to their own field, increasing the force they are launched away. If a target's melee weapon is charged the same as the target, their strength is reduced by that charge when using that weapon for melee, as a portion of their strength is being used to hold the weapon with a magnetic push from the one holding it, but their OP with it would increase as the push from the user is increased.

[C]Targets may also be connected by opposing fields, becoming grappled together with a force of #Str depending on the #ib of force between them. If their is a pulling force between two subjects that are not touching but within magnetic range, their speed is reduced moving away from eachother, or increased if moving towards eachother by an amount equal to the total force. 

[C]A maximum of 100ib of force may be charged to any field at a time, whether that is 10 T1 charges, 1 T10 Charge, 2 T5 Charges, etc.

*There are many out of the box uses for this ability and creative manipulations of the gravitational pulls and pushes of the environment and subjects when in it. The results of these unstated uses of this ability should be discussed and agreed upon by the overseeing Anbu at the time if applicable, or if need be, voted on by Advisors and or Daimyo.

[C]The user concentrates their explosive chakra into the palm of their hand, carefully as to have the resulting Jutsu harm the user, but rather aim away. This explosion only reaches within close to mid range, using ones own OP+2 to hit, and whatever is on the opposing end takes 4 damage and +1°Burn! This can would also blast a target back 4 meters and knock them prone if hit directly!

[C]This can be used in conjunction with taijutsu, adding this explosive damage on top of ones own melee attack, but the user must hit with an open palm. If the user uses their natural DP to block an attack, they may also use this to damage the attacker or their weapon! A user may also cleverly use this to deflect, and redirect,  ranged projectiles! If one blocks a ranged attack with their natural DP, they can use this ability to send the projectile back at the thrower, however doing so damages the projectile, possibly even breaking it.

[C]For every additional +4ChP pushed into this jutsu, the effect is increased by about 50%, adding +2 Damage, +1 OP, +1°Burn per tier.

[C]The castor may either absorb the chakra into the upper square of the mark on their left hand or their mouth. By using the upper diamond on their palm, requiring the user to first Defend or Evade against the jutsu, then absorbing the Ninjutsu by burning half ChP it's worth. By using their mouth, the technique's range is bigger as their mouth becomes like a giant jutsu-suctioning vacuum, decreasing the EP or DP cost to absorb by 25%, but increases the ChP required to absorb it to 75% of the Ninjutsu's worth. 

[C]To properly deconstruct and store the jutsu, the castor must have the available slots in their Jutsu Bank to comprehend a jutsu of it's rank. This technique may be able to absorb elemental Ninjutsu made of chakra, but cannot absorb naturally accuring elements, such as water from a river or fire from a torch nor of special types of chakra the user is not able to use, such as Nature Chakra or Tailed Beast Chakra without being a Sage or Jinchuriki.

As the user activates this Jutsu 10, 15 meter trees begin to sprout from the ground where the user wants them, the user is freely able to control the trees once they are created and may spend an additional 10 chakra points to sprout another tree, along with growing each one by 5 more meters, each tree has a Strength of 50 and Dp of 45, as they grow they gain +10Strength/Dp per 5 meters!

If the user runs out of chakra or is knocked out they lose control of the trees leaving them in whatever position they were before, the user may also mold the tree in whatever shape they want, instantly creating shelters with the trees stats. The trees will remain even after the users death unless destroyed or dispelled by the user.

Description:
 
One can move so fast that those too slow only see an after image of what was, those who wield swift release have the potential to learn this technique. However to create an after image would require great skill and as such not many active speeds of this level. Those who do gain a massive advantage against an opponent too slow to stop them.

As an attack approaches the user they can choose to dodge it, paying chakra equal to 50% of the EP required to leave an after image as they disappear from view effectively granting them full stealth for a turn with no cover unless the foe is aware of this technique or has double the speed stat thus making it half stealth. The user will however have to dodge the attack completely and if there are several then using it on the first gives the after image EP equal to half of the user’s speed to use.

Alternatively one could use the after image technique to fool opponents before they can even attack, by paying 25% of their OP with both chakra and EP one can leave an after image for a turn as they gain either half or full stealth given the situation. Regardless of which way this technique is used one cannot increase it’s effectiveness in tiers making it useful in certain situations but not always working.

It's lowest form, it has a DP of 60. It's size and shape are maluable to the castors needs, but the sum of it's thickness, height, and width/length can stretch no more than 10 meters. For example: 1m thick, 4m high, 5m long. For every additional 15ChP, the total size and DP increases by +10. Similarly to earth wall this technique stays after being cast.

[Bc]Description:
[C]This ability, a hallmark of the Hōzuki clan, allows the user to liquefy any part of their body at will, from the hair on their head to the muscles in their arms. When the user is struck by a physical attack, the impacted area becomes liquid, causing the attack to pass through them and leave them unharmed. The user then solidifies back into their original form. Despite the versatility of their liquid states, they are unable to counter elemental Ninjutsu  this way, rendering Hōzuki very vulnerable to Lightning Release, as well as effects from Poison, recieving double the damage, but halving that of Fire Jutsu.

[C]It is said that 60% of the human body is is water, and though Hōzuki may temporarily change this too 100%, they have a Water Pool, (WP), equal to 60% of their max HP in ounces. This is filled by drinking, typically water, or instantly absorbing water while fully liquified! This technique does not liquify ones items or clothes, but such things may be carried along within your liquified mass. If your WP is 0, your body cannot liquify. When you return your body to a solid state, it returns to it's previous condition it was before liquifying. 

[C]Whenever they liquify to bypass physical attacks, they use their WP instead of HP. They may also use their own WP to perform Water jutsu when seemingly no water is around, where 1 WP = 2oz.

[C]Hōzuki may fully liquify their entire body to perform a number of amazing things. Once fully liquified, they may slip through otherwise impassable obstacles,  camouflage onto the surface of water, triple their swimming speed, and breathe underwater! 

[C]While in a fully liquified state, on land, they will be treated as "Prone", but solidifying from this state will nullify your Prone status, or even Grappled Status, without reducing any remaining movement distance! If a portion of their body becomes disabled, (eyes, ears, limbs), they can liquify and solidify that portion, and burn 10% WP to repair it. To regrow completely lost limbs, -20%WP must be spent from a fully liquified state. They may also use this technique to heal tiers of Bleed and Burn at the equivalent %cost of their max WP, (-1%Bleed =-1%WP).

[Bc]Description:
[C]By putting the Hydrification Technique into practical use, the muscles of the arm are temporarily enlarged and strengthened. Moisture is gathered from the whole body and compressed into the entire arm, like an instant pump-up. However, because it is essential to properly control the moisture balance inside the body, this technique's degree of difficulty is very high. The technique gives the user superhuman strength, capable of breaking through both rock walls and steel doors with ease and able to wield two handed weapons with a single arm!

[C]This technique may only be used on one limb at a time.This increases the Strength and Stamina of the user's Arm by +15 per tier, also increasing the DP, OP and ROP when using this arm. Despite the name, this technique may also be used on a user's Leg, (Gōsui-ashi). Using this technique on one's leg increases the limb's Strength and Speed by +15, also increasing the EP, OP, and Movement Speed when using this leg.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Shikotsumyaku is a kekkei genkai which gives its wielder the ability to manipulate their own bones. It manifests within members of the Kaguya clan. Users of Shikotsumyaku possess three unique skills: the ability to control their osteoblasts (cells responsible for producing bones); the ability to control their osteoclasts (cells responsible for breaking down bones); the ability to regulate their bones' calcium density.

[C]With Shikotsumyaku, users can grow new bones anywhere in their body. Typically these bones are functionally and visually identical to other bones in the body, such as the spine or ribs. Other times the bones will be similar to standard bones, but with specific alterations. If the user chooses, they can create entirely original bones with no clear parallels.

[C]]You may create any physical [|][Weapon or Tool|http://aminoapps.com/p/n0y9sp][|] out of your own bones for the cost of 1 Max Chakra Point and 2 Max Health Points per 3 Stat Points, adjusting the density of the bone that is forming the object, making it harder, lighter, stronger, or faster, distributing the stat points as they please as they form the macabre instrument. Using this technique, they may also re-absorb any bones they have formed or extended from their body, restoring +1MChP and +2 MHP from every 3 stat points of the item, stat points ≤2 will restore MHP. This may also be restored by absorbing osteoclasts of the deceased...

[C]To compensate for the drastic effect this ability would have on a person of normal anatomy, the Kaguya clan have a unique physiology and healing factor. Using their ability causes 1 teir of bleeding, but they naturally heal 1 tier of bleeding per round. They may also remove broken bones to grow new replacements practically instantly!

*This ability's usage must always be posted publicly via chatroom or blog, and the user's status must be updated accordingly.

[Bc]Description:
[C]The user parts their fingertips, creating holes that expose hardened finger bones. They can fire these with pulses of chakra individually or in volleys (five per hand, 10 max at a time), causing a loud sound as they're fired. The bullets travel incredibly quickly through the air and take a spinning motion. Upon impact, the bullets tear through skin, flesh, bone and can even pierce a samurai's armour.

[C]Each bullet fired is similar to a Senbon, (Finger Shrapnel <Sharp/3Damage>), but are destroyed once they make any sort of impact. This techniq does not cause any bleeding, however, if all 5 fingertips on a single hand are fired, the hand is disabled until the start of the user's following turn. The castor may also theoretically use their toes, disabling the foot if 5 toe bones are shot, disabling that leg. Only one digit is restored per round.

[Bc]Description:
[C]This technique uses the same principles as "Dead Bone Pulse" in functionality, and is just as versatile,  but it in utility it is optimized for convenience in the field.

[C]In practice, the castor forms or manipulates their bones to create offensive or defensive forms, however,  unlike Shikotsumyaku's useage, the castor does not need the time to form and draw full arsenals, instead forming protrusions directly through their skin while remaining completely connected to their body, keeping their hands free!

[C]These partial formations can take the shape of blades, spikes, rods, or coverings made of bone. For every Tier, one of these protrusions may be formed with a stat value of 15 points. 

[C]If "Sharp" protrusions are formed suddenly at the point of a would be impacted area, the attacker must spend EP equivilent to half of their own attack to avoid damaging their weapons, or even mutilating themselves...

[C]As per Shikotsumyaku's normal use, each use, regardless of Tier, causes 1 Tier of Bleeding to the user, but also causes +1 Bleed when suddenly retracted! Luckily, their body's natural ability to naturally heal 1 Tier of Bleeding per round helps to slightly compensate for this physical trauma. As mentioned, just as these may passivley be formed on a whim, these formations may passivley re-absorbed, restoring +1ChP and +2 HP from every 3 stat points of the growth, any surplus stat points will restore HP.

[Bc]Description:
[C]The Kaguya uses their unique anatomy and chakra to transfer their osteoclasts from inside their body to just under/over the top layer of their skin through their pores, weakening their endoskeleton to form an exoskeleton...

[C]This creates +30 Temp HP, (HP: #/#+30), at the cost of 15ChP and -10 Total Nat DP (-10 Current & -10 Max DP), making the bone layered, denser, and stronger. This exoskeleton protects the user's direct health and even protects them from threats that could normally bypass DP. This layer of bone protecting vitals and veins also defends the user not only from attacks that would cause bleed, but also allows the use of "Dead Bone Pulse" techniques by using Temp HP instead of Nat HP, and without causing Tiers of Bleed from these techniques, (this does not protect from effects of Burn, Poison, Frostbite, Shock, Acid, etc). This technique may also be used in reverse to convert it's Temp HP back to Total Nat DP, and ChP, any surplus points restoring Nat DP.

Description:
 
This technique is a powerful offshoot of the Kaguya in which the castor can pour their osteoblasts into the ground, causing blades of bone to sprout from the earth!  Because of how fast the bones shoot up from the ground and how far and tall they can grow, the Dead Bone Ferns skew any unsuspecting target in their path!

For the cost of -4HP and -8ChP, the castor creates a meter tall & foot wide spike, a T1 Bone Fern (Sharp, 3DMG, 3DP, 3’) that shoots up from the ground at their target. This has a reach equal to half the castor’s ROP. This attacks ROP is equal to the user’s ROP-Distance of target, however, each spike is considered half stealth unless somehow sensed or tracked before sprouting.

For each Tier, the max range is increased by +1 and another spike may sprout from the ground, or the stats of a singular spike may be stacked as it grows larger, stronger, and sprouts more “branches”, potentially forming a garden of death, or an unyeilding bone tree.

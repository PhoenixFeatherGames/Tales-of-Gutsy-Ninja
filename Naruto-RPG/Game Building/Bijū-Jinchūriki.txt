[C][|] This Ten-Tails (十尾, Jūbi) is the combined form of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki and the God Tree, known only to her as Gyokuto, created to reclaim the chakra inherited by her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura. It is regarded as the progenitor of chakra, and is tied to the legend of the Sage of Six Paths and the birth of shinobi. To end the beast's rampage, the Sage became the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki and later split its chakra into the nine tailed beasts to prevent it from causing further harm. [|]

The Zero-Tails is a malevolent entity by nature, resembling a dark purple leech with a serpent-like body. On its face, it wears a blank white coloured Noh mask that has the kanji for "zero" (零, rei) on it, which is tan in colour and five red hair-like strands sprouting from it four at the top and one at the bottom. The Zero-Tails showed to be capable of distorting its mask to resemble expressions. It also has a mouth that can open very wide, and it contains large molars. [|]

[Cbi]The Tailed Beasts (尾獣, Bijū) are the nine titanic living forms of chakra created by the Sage of Six Paths out of the chakra from the single Ten-Tails Bijū. They are differentiated by the number of tails they have, ranging from one to nine. However, the Ten-Tailed Beast is included under this catagory, as well as the rumored Zero-Tails Bijū said to have been artificially created by human kind...
[Cbi]Long before the founding of the hidden villages, the Sage of Six Paths saved the world by sealing the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki. Some time later, the Sage was inspired by his youngest son to use his "Creation of All Things" technique to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine living entities, which would become the tailed beasts. The Sage named the nine and explained to them that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again — though not as they were — and that at that time, someone would emerge to show them what true power was. They were to only share their true names with such individuals that had managed to earn their respect and form perfect bonds with them, but only one individual in a lifetime other than himself would ever be able to earn all nine names.
[Cbi]The Sage and his followers built temples in nine different regions of the world where the tailed beasts could live, be protected, and even worshipped as their presence served as an anchor of order, lest risk enciting their chaotic fury on par to natural disaster. The tailed beasts were originally created not only to prevent the Ten-Tails' resurrection, but also to maintain balance and peace. This balance would be destroyed however as an individual named Mara Uchiha set out to irradicate all nine bijū in order to establish his own dominance and that of his village in the year of 963, intending to fill this power vaccum himself and destroy these powers that could threaten his goal of world peace under one being, only instead to throw the shinobi world into the first Great Shinobi World War, and discover the Bijū's true potential shortly before death at the hands of his only and best friend, as well as greatest rival, Harama Senju. And to his grave, he left only a whisper, a rumor, that the tailed beasts could not be killed, and would one day reform in the world, and that their power would be his...
[Bci]In the year of 996, 33 years later, after the Chūnin Exams were held in the village of Konoha, rumors had began to spread accross the world of the Bijū returning to existence, and behind the scenes, the shinobi nations, and underground organizations alike, began preparing, planning to reclaim these beasts, for they knew the momentary peace they have enjoyed was but an illusion, and that only by obtaining these beasts would they hope to survive the ensuing chaos, and hope to bring order once again.
[Bci]Each of the tailed beasts have their own unique abilities, but they all share the same core attributes: They are massive, all being roughly 50 meters on size, they have massive quantities of powerful red Bijū Chakra that can form jutsu up to the 30th tier, can easily transfer their chakra to whomever they choose, condensed into a thicker Jinchuriki Chakra, and can use the Tailed Beast Bomb. The Jūbi, said to be the origionator of this worlds chakra, is said to hold the purest, able to reach the 50th tier with their Godly Chakra. Because the tailed beasts are pure chakra, they cannot actually be killed; if they or their jinchūriki die, their chakra will re-coalesce in time.
[Bci]Jinchūriki are humans that have tailed beasts sealed within them. They exhibit extraordinary powers due to the immense chakra reserves they possess. In addition to the chakra reserves, jinchūriki gain abilities unique to the respective beast. As the jinchūriki transform themselves into the likeness of their tailed beasts, it further increases the power of their abilities. If they are able to survive their beast's removal, they will still have access to those abilities, however, the forced removal of a Bijū from it's host almost always garentees the Jinchuriki's death without incredibly specific and unique preperations or techniques to circumvent this fate.

[IMG=6TT]
[Bci]Jinchūriki (人柱力, Power of Human Sacrifice) are humans that have tailed beasts sealed within them. They exhibit extraordinary powers due to the immense and potent chakra reserves they possess.
[Bci]A millennium ago, the world was terrorised by a rampaging, colossal monster known as the Ten-Tails. Eventually, through the combined efforts of the twin brothers, Hagoromo and Hamura Ōtsutsuki, the Ten-Tails was defeated and sealed within Hagoromo, becoming its jinchūriki. Throughout his travels, Hagoromo used the Ten-Tails' power to perform many great deeds and promote peace during his lifetime, causing him to be revered as the "Sage of Six Paths". Towards the end of his life, Hagoromo, knowing the Ten-Tails would be unleashed on the world again when he died, split its chakra into nine living entities called the tailed beasts.
[Bci][Bci]In the year of 996, after the Chūnin Exams were held in the village of Konoha, rumors had began to spread accross the world of the Bijū returning to existence, and behind the scenes, the shinobi nations, and underground organizations alike, began preparing, planning to reclaim these beasts, for they knew the momentary peace they have enjoyed was but an illusion, and that only by obtaining these beasts would they hope to survive the ensuing chaos, and hope to bring order once again.
[Bci]Inspired by legends of The Sage of 6-Paths, the best way these villages and organizations believed to tame and control these beasts of equivalent legend was to seal them into living hosts. Younger hosts were ideal for comtaining these beasts in order to better grow with them and extend the time needed between transfering hosts. Befitting the name, these "Human Sacrifices" would potentially gain great power, if they could handle it, however were doomed to ostracism of their peers, close moniterization by their hierarchy, doomed to be under constant threat to their lives by those who fear or envy their power, and, doomed to die, as one day they would need to transfer their Bijū to a new host, and the extraction garenteed their painful death.
[Bci]Once a beast is sealed inside the host, they gain "Bijutsu" added to their skill list with a single point, and gain the [|][Tailed Beast Cloak|http://aminoapps.com/p/kybzfy][|] Technique in their Jutsu Bank, regardless of available slots. They also gain any KKG or Advanced Nature releases of their Bijū. The Bijū's BChP is condensed, divided by 3 to become Jinchūriki Chakra. JChP, like BChP, are potent enough to cast jutsu up to the 30th tier, however, every 1 point in this pool is worth 3 BChP. For every 1 point in the Bijutsu skill, the host is able to draw 1% of their sealed beasts total power with the Tailed Beast Cloak active, sort of like a backup battery supply. This Cloak will automatically activate if the Bijū's host's life is on danger, for their own preservation, temporarily increasing their hosts Bijutsu score by +10, and increasing by +1 per round, however, under this circumstance, the Bijū will be in control, in a rage, destroying and attacking everything and everyone, primarily whatever is the most immediate threat, is closest, or holds their aggro, until the host can Will it back, removing any temporary boost once back in control. The first time the host may tap into said power of the Bijū Cloak must be in this life threatening way.

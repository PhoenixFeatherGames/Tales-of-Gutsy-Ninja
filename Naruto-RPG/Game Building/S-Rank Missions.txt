[Bc]Mission:
[C]The Tailed Beasts of old once thought destroyed by man have returned, reformed seemingly from the ether after thirty-three years, back unto our world with the power to destroy it entirely. 

[C]Leaders of all Shinobi nations found our selves with no alternative but to hold the first Kage Summit in forty-four years. We came to the conclusion that these beasts may seek revenge upon us snd may pose a a threat we cannot afford if allowed to exist, however,  they cannot be destroyed, as they seemingly shall simply reform once more. The alternative solution we came to would be to seal these beasts away, but the only secure and and strong enough prison to potentially contain these creatures and control their untamed power would be Shinobi strong enough to face them.

[C]This mission is is crucial not only to the security and safety of our village, or our country, but of this world, and I will only entrust this mission and the entailed danger of this task to a team of strong and loyal Shinobi. The mission, if so chosen to accept, will be to subdue the Tailed Beast that resides within our country, and to have the creature sealed within your own body, volunteering oneself or selves to become Jinchūriki behilden to our village and our country. 

[C]Once this mission is accepted, the commissioned will be issued the last seen coordinates of the Bijū and shall be followed by a team of our villages most elite sealers who will have strict orders to not assist or engage for any circumstance who will observe from at least a one mile distance. Once the Bijū is rendered fully unconcious, they shall move in to temporarily seal the beast into a portable medium and escort the team back to an undisclosed location within the village, where a week long process must swiftly commence in order to seal the beast into a proper and suitable host and monerter the recovery of the newly established Jinchūriki.

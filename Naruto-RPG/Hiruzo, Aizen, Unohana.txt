[IMG=K4X]
[C][|]Clan: [Sarutobi|http://aminoapps.com/p/9mjk7f] [|]
[C][|] Sex: M [|]
[C][|] Age: 54 [|]
[C][|] Height: 5'4" [|]
[C][|] Chakra Natures: 火², 風, 雷  [|]
[C][|] Personality: When he was younger, Hiruzō was a hot-headed and eager ninja with a strong desire to prove himself. Hiruzō was a firm believer in the Will of Fire, which holds that all the people of Konoha are a family and that the Hokage is chiefly responsible for that family's well-being. Although he still holds these beliefs, his softness, politeness, warmth, compassion,  all grew to become a mask after the war. Throughout his tenure, Hiruzō lives up to the Will of Fire by being available for Konoha's villagers and shinobi during their time of need, making decisions to the betterment of as many people as possible, and providing his wisdom and guidance whenever he can, However,  after losing those closest to him in the war, he never let anyone close enough to him to be friends, as he never wanted to lean on someone or be leaned on again, to let those he felt close to die for him, to let them die for nothing. As an adult, Hiruzō was a completely calm, cold and collected individual beneath the surface who would do anything, kill anyone he needed to, in order to protect his village and his family. As such, he has no remorse taking any immoral actions as long as he believed it would benefit Konoha and it's people. [|]

[C][|] History: Hiruzō Sarutobi and his two teamates, Unohana Senju and Aizen Uchiha, were in a squad together under the legendary 2nd Hokage during the second Shinobi World War. He was no specialist in genjutsu like Aizen, nor a master of Iryojutsu like Unohana, and he certainly was no expert swordsmen.  He was not the smartest, fastest, or strongest, but inside him, the will of fire burned the brightest. The 2nd Hokage always praised Hiruzō and his noble heart over his friend Aizen, who their sensei always felt never truly valued the lives of fellow shinobi with Aizen's questionable leadership, sacrificial, stratagies... However,  their sensei always seemed closest the Senju amongst them, Unohana, and her masterful healing ability, which saved many lives that could have been lost. Towards the climax of the war, the four of them were going to be pinned by a massive ambush, the 2nd Hokage told them someone would have to be left behind. Aizen agreed but did not volenteer. Unohana insisted they all stay and fight to the death. Hiruzō volunteered, issuing the 2nd to declare him the new hokage before leaving to hold off the ambush. The war was almost won, but there was one decisive battle, and Aizen was entrusted to plan it. It was this folly that lead to Unohana's death, however,  it was also what lead to their ultimate victory, and Aizens death... Aizens final strategy ensured not only the life of  their remaining shinobi, but saved the life of Hiruzo, at the cost of his own... [|]

[C][|] Nindo: "Only absolute fortitude may reveal ones absolute truth." "Love is the key to peace." "All of whom possess the Will of Fire are family. The desire to protect one's family builds thicker and stronger bonds between each and everyone in the village. If the Will of Fire is embraced by everyone, the village will be alright no matter what." "In the light, I am the leaves that bask in the sun and provide cover to my family, however, I am also the growing roots that support my village in the dark... [|]

[Bcu][|] About Aizen [|]
[IMG=FGP]
[C][|]Clan: Uchiha [|]
[C][|] Sex: M [|]
[C][|] Age: 25 [|]
[C][|] Height: 6'1" [|]
[C][|] Chakra Natures: 陰, 水 [|]
[C][|] Personality: Aizen is a polite, soft-spoken intellectual, often addressing his subordinates by their given names. He rarely shows any sign of alarm or distress, and often has entire situations planned out well in advance. Whenever confronted, Aizen is casual and uncaring, attempting to draw out a conversation and make small talk, which often infuriates those he is talking to. Aizen initially appears to be very kind to most, a well-respected shinobi who is looked up to by many, however, this is just a mask to disguise his manipulative, and very dangerous, nature. In truth, he cares very little for his underlings, and is willing to use almost everyone around him as specks in a bigger picture, stepping stones to reach his goals, soldiers to fight and fall for their nation, pawns to fall for the king... He is willing to stop at nothing to further his ambitions which he finds to be for the greater good, including manipulating or killing anyone if he deems it to be necessary. It's also worth noting, he very much enjoyed toying with his opponents,  particularly with mind games... [|]

[C][|] History:  Aizen Uchiha and his two teamates, Unohana Senju and Hiruzo Sarutobi, were in a squad together under the legendary 2nd Hokage during the second Shinobi World War. He was a master of genjutsu, even before he began to develop the Sharingan, however, is use of illusions was questionable, even at times casting it on allies to "boost their moral", "crush resistance", or just to toy with them if they overstepped their place... The 2nd Hokage always praised his rival Hiruzo and his noble, ignorant heart over him, who their sensei always felt never truly valued the lives of fellow shinobi with Aizen's questionable leadership and efficient, yet sacrificial, stratagies... However,  their sensei always clearly favorored the Senju amongst them, Unohana, and her masterful healing ability, which saved many lives that would have been lost to Aizen's strategies. Towards the climax of the war, the four of them were going to be pinned by a massive ambush, the 2nd Hokage told them someone would have to be left behind. Aizen agreed but did not volenteer. Unohana insisted they all stay and fight to the death. Hiruzo volunteered, issuing the 2nd to declare him the new hokage before leaving to hold off the ambush.

Aizens final strategy ensured not only the life of  their remaining shinobi, but saved the life of Hiruzo, at the cost of his own... Unohana and Aizen both voluntarily became Edo Tensei for Hiruzo to summon to his side from the pure lands when needed, to protect the leaf, to save lives, and for redemption of their past sins...

"If one abandons all other abilities and focuses his strength entirely on a single specialized skill, then he can overcome even the greatest of powers." "authoritative reality. Regardless, every being in this world lives misrecognizing only convenient “facts” as truth. This is because they have no other way to live. However, for the powerless who make up the majority of this world, the inconvenient “facts” they affirm through themselves is entirely the truth." [|]

[C][|] Sex: F [|]
[C][|] Age: 26 [|]
[C][|] Height: 5'2" [|]
[C][|] Chakra Natures: 陽, 土 [|]
[C][|] Personality: Typically, Unohana is a kind woman with a motherly attitude benefiting of her appearance. She is incredibly polite, always addressing her subordinates, colleagues, and even her enemies with honorifics. She never hesitates to immediately heal those in nedd with her masterful iryojutsu. Perhaps due to being thrown into the 2nd shinobi world war at such a young age, she rarely shows signs of surprise and rarely displays any signs of emotional distress, regardless of the situation. A natural leader, even before becoming the squad captain during the absense of the 2nd Hokage, and given charge of her own division of troops. Unohana commanded the respect of those around her, often being related as the "Mom" or "Big Sister", especially amongst her own team, but even to those outside of her division. She has a profound sense of duty, able to lay aside her personal feelings for the betterment of her mission. Despite all of this, Unohana has a dark side to her personality, which she usually keeps completely hidden.. [|]

[C][|] History:  Unohana Senju and her two teamates, Aizen Uchiha and Hiruzo Sarutobi, were in a squad together under the legendary 2nd Hokage during the second Shinobi World War. Though to most she may seem like a caring, gentle healer, her true nature is a cold blooded killer, possibly triggered by fighting in a war since the age of 7. This supresssed persona goes by the name "Kenpachi"... In her "Kenpachi" persona, she is cold and uncaring, harboring a blood-chilling glare. She has shown that she can easily kill in cold blood without harboring any regret for her actions. At the age if 13, before being placed under the direct supervision of the 2nd Hokqge, she took part in the complete genocide of a  minor clan that decided to defect, even after they swore to return after already being beaten to submission, healed, then beaten again, which she feels no remorse for. Towards the climax of the war, the four of them were going to be pinned by a massive ambush, the 2nd Hokage told them someone would have to be left behind. Aizen agreed but did not volenteer. Unohana insisted they all stay and fight to the death. Hiruzo volunteered, issuing the 2nd to declare him the new hokage before leaving to hold off the ambush. The war was almost won, but there was one decisive battle, and Aizen was entrusted to plan it. Her "Kenpachi" personality was shown to be capable of unnerving and even scaring the likes of Aizen Uchiha, who had believed himself to have the coldest heart until witnessing her release "Kenpachi" in the war after their Sensei had fallen, no longer around to supress it... This also lead to Aizen's plan to force her into a position to unleash "Kenpachi" in the decisive battle that ultimately succeeded in guaranteeing victory, but at the cost of her life, and ultimately Aizen's. Unohana and Aizen both voluntarily became Edo Tensei for Hiruzo to summon to his side from the pure lands when needed, to protect the leaf, to save lives, and for redemption of their past sins...

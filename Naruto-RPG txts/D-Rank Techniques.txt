[Bc]Description:
[C]The Tree Climbing Technique involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet, and using that to climb a tree without using one's hands. If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off. If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to break around the point of contact and the user will fall. This does not apply only to trees, but any surface vertical, horizontal, or even upside down!

[Bc]Description:
[C]To do this, the user has to be emitting a constant stream of chakra from the bottom of the their feet and using the repellent force to walk across the water's surface. This technique is more difficult to master than the Tree Climbing Technique, because the amount of chakra that needs to be emitted changes constantly. It doesn't have to just be at the feet. A user under water can focus chakra on their hands or any other body part that makes contact with the surface of the water. If they were submerged, they can climb atop the water as if they were climbing out of a pool.

[Bc]Description:
[C]The Body Flicker Technique is a high-speed movement technique. By using the Body Flicker Technique, a ninja can move short to long distances at an almost untraceable speed. To an observer, it appears as if the user has teleported. It is accomplished by using chakra to temporarily vitalise the body and move at extreme speeds. The amount of chakra required depends on the overall distance between the user and the intended destination. A puff of smoke is occasionally used to disguise the user's movements. Other nearby elements or substances can be used instead to distract the opponent such as leaves, sand, water, etc. As such, this ability grants the user an extra +5 temporary EP or OP/ROP, and in the right situation,  grant the user half stealth.

[C]The Geppo allows the users to actually jump, (not step), off the air itself, allowing them to stay in the air for much longer than usual and move more freely within a three dimensional space. These jumps may actually be treated as having had "running starts" to determine their height/distance, +6(Inches/Feet). Users may even use this technique to cross great distances without ever touching the ground, set themselves up for swift, aerial attacks, or use it to cushion their fall damage by half!

[C]While the technique itself affords several advantages both in and out of battle for the user, it has but one major weakness: since its usage depends heavily on the user's legs, restraining or pinning down any major parts of their lower body can significantly disrupt Geppo.

[C]By molding ones chakra and the earth, castors expend 5 chakra points to tunnel out 1×1 meters of earth, typically 1 meter in diameter, 1 meter deep, per use. An additional 3 ChP may be spent every 1 cubic meter moved for a maximum of 10m per round.

[C]If this technique were to be reversed in order to fill 1 cubic meter, these manipulated earth would have a DP of 10, as well as a grapple score of 10, pinning any within the filled space who cannot react to the castor's R.O.P. +(3 Per Cubic Meter).

Users use the surrounding moisture to fill the air with mist and condense it's thickness with their chakra. Once the mists are thick enough that opponents cannot see, that in turn means they cannot manage much defense against the user.

The Jutsu is centered on the user upon creation, spreading out to a Diameter of 5 Meters and a hieght of 3 meters. The size is increased by 2m×1m for every extra 3ChP spent per round the mist is formed. Along with the user instantly gaining the "Half-stealth" effect upon use.

 Everyone inside this mist, including the user, is treated as if "Blinded", as well as anyone outside looking, or attacking, into the Mist. Hieghtened sensiry capabilities or Doujutsu reduce this effect to "Half Blind".

The resulting effect reduces the target's EP, DP, OP, ROP, effective vision, and Movement Speed by 10% as long as they are under the effects of this genjutsu. 

[C]To place a target under this effect, the castor must face their enemy with the open palm of their hand from as far as 10 meters away, using ones ROP to hit, and the user must stay in this range of their target or the Genjutsu will break. Every +5ChP extra pumped into this jutsu increases its range by 5 meters and its effect by +5%.

[Bc]Description
[C]Much like its parent Jutsu, the Transformation Technique, this allows the user to cloak their true firm via taking the appearance and properties of another. However, unlike the generic version however, this variation is far more specific, focused, detailed... For this, one must have a deep understanding of the human form, anatomy, and mind, for they must take what they believe to be a form attractive enough to stun their target, a scantly clad or even nude visage, most often of the opposite sex, unable to rely on the cover of familiar cloth, they must perfectly replicate the skin, flesh, voice, and most alluring attributes of their targets desire! 

[C]This is best used when the targets guard is down, but it's hard for any to mentally prepare for such a tact, requiring the castors ROP to avoid the gaze of or simply resist with sheer mental fortitude or be Stunned for that round or until struck! One caught completely by surprise will suffer +2 Bleed and be launched up and back 10 feet, falling prone. As long as you remain in this form, you gain a +5 Temp OP and EP that restores to 5 at the start if each turn transformed. 

[C]This costs -3ChP for every consecutive minute transformed and can be dismissed at will, or forcibly being directly stuck, running out of Chakra, or falling unconcious. This will not have any effect non-intellilectual life forms or beings in uncontrollably, bloodlusted states.

Description:
 
This technique subjects targets to visions of their greatest fear, regardless of whether or not they're aware that they're afraid of it. This "fear" can be something that the target is actually scared of or merely the one image that they least want to see.
While under the effect of this genjutsu, the target are frozen with fear, treated as though if "Prone" as long as they are under this illusion!

To place a target under this effect, the castor, using their R.O.P.,  momentarily raises debris, such as leaves, dirt, or water, around their target, enough to obscure their vision of the world around them. The target must be within 5 meters of the user.
The user may fuel the illusion with more chakra, making it feel more realistic, and increasing the grip it has on the target. For every additional 5Chp used, the Intelligence needed to discern the technique increases by 5%, and the Genjutsu skill needed to break out also increases by 5%. The range will also increase by 3 meters.

[Bc]Cost:
[C]5 Chakra Point per Bell Ringing/ Note Played (Non-Bell Instruments) & 5 Chakra Points Per Round Rung/Played
[Bc]Description:
[C]The user utilises the ringing of instruments, such as bells, to produce a sound wave that travels through the eardrum directly into the target's brain. This debilitates the victim while also causing them to hallucinate, seeing multiple images of the user, which makes it difficult for them to tell the real one from the illusions. The user can then take advantage of this to easily attack the victim! 

[C]The user amplifies this ringing sound with yin chakra in order to implant the genjutsu into the target's head, causing a sense of vertigo, inflicting the "Prone" status, aswell as causing them to see double, which in essense, inflicts effects similar to if they were attacking or defending against a clone, and this effect stacks with each bell rung/ note played, increasing, it's decibels as more chakra amplifies the signal, and increasing the effective range by +1m with the ampliied dB, and causing them them to see another double and adding an additional tier/round of "Prone". These doubles mimic the castor exactly, can only be seen by the effected targets, and are all within 1m per tier of the castor.

[C]This jutsu is treated as half stealth, using the castor's ROP, against any target within range of the Bell/Instrument to react to, either by covering their ears or escaping the frequencies dB, adding +3 resulting ROP per tier. The castor must have some physical connection to the musical medium in order to not only continue its sound, but channel their chakra through the resulting sound waves.

[Bc]Description:
[C]The user delivers a combo of high and low kicks, each of which is fast enough that the untrained eye can't even react to them! When the user performs this technique, they start with a backwards, spinning high kick using their first foot, the motion of which then helps them deliver a low kick with theur second. Although the first kick is damaging on its own, it's primarily intended as a distraction, forcing the target to block it and thus rendering them vulnerable to the second kick.

[C]This technique has two parts, each treated as a half action, the second of which may not be performed unless the first has been. The EP of the first kick is increased by +8, but it's damage is reduced by -8. The second kick takes advantage of the built kinetic force,  increasing it's damage by +8, but it's EP is reduced by -8 given the less favorable position and lack of momentum. Additionally,  this second kick will typically send the targed flying back through the air by meters equal to distance traveled between the user and their target, falling prone. Even if blocked, the target will typically knocked back, but by half the would be distance and not be left prone.

[C]For each additional 4 EP exerted per kick, the user will see a +4 increase to the buffs and distance target is knocked back, however would lose -4 to the debuffs, balencing their need for speed and strength.

[C]This may only be performed by successfully defending against a melee attack. After successful DP calculation,  the user may exert their own EP this kick as their counter! It is treated as a half action, but the EP is increased by +8! Any distance traveled by the attacker before attempting to strike the user is the distance they are sent spinning away!

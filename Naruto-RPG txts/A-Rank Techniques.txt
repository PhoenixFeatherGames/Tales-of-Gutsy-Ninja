[Bc]Description:
[C]The Rasengan is a spinning ball of pure chakra is formed and held in the palm of the user's hand.The Rasengan was created based on observations made of the [|] [Tailed Beast Bomb|http://aminoapps.com/p/dknqh4r] [|], intended to be the highest form of shape transformation. The Rasengan does not require hand seals to perform. Once it is formed, it also does not require any additional chakra to sustain it, which means that there is no definite limit to how long the Rasengan can be maintained, however,  more chakra may be pumped into it to increase it's size and power. However, the Rasengan will dissipate if it collides with something, even if it's an unintended target. On contact, the Rasengan grinds into its target, propels them along the Rasengan's trajectory - either away from the user or into the ground beneath them - and at some point bursts, causing severe damage at the point of contact. Though not as masterful as it's shape transformation, givin it's elementless nature, one may add properties of an elemenral nature into this technique via [|] [Chakra Flow|http://aminoapps.com/p/6ce2ro] [|].

[C]Hitting someone with this deals melee damage once it hits them and the raw energy causes 1° Burn, from there, the Rasengan launches the target 10 feet in the direction of its trajectory before erupting and dealing 40 Damage! Every additional 13ChP put in, incrementally increases the size of the Rasengan, (6", 12", 18", etc), and increases the distance by 5 feet, the damage by +20, and +1 burn.

[BC]Prerequisite 
[C]One must have 200 Chakra Control and 200 Experience 
[Bc]Cost:
[C]22 Chakra Points
[Bc]Description:
[C]To perform, the user first gathers lightning to their hand; the high concentration of electricity produces a sound reminiscent of many birds chirping, hence the name. Once the chakra is gathered, users charge at their target and thrust the Chidori into them, piercing them and typically causing fatal damage. Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it's used makes it useful for assassinations. If one is hit by this, the target takes melee damage as well as +35 Lightning Damage that also shocks them and makes them Bleed. Unlike many other jutsu, this jutsu can not be improved by adding more chakra into it.

[C]The speed at which the Chidori is performed, despite being one of its greatest assets, also represents one of its biggest drawbacks. On one hand, ½ of the distance traveled between point A to point B is added to this attack's OP and Damage. However, users move at their target so fast that its causes a tunnel vision-like effect for them. Because they charge in a straight line it is easy for opponents to attack them, and because of the tunnel vision it is difficult for the user to see these attacks, much less react to them, unable to Evade or Defend from counter attacks. For this reason, most ninja cannot use the Chidori safely. However, a user of special visual abilities, such as with the Sharingan or Byakugan, can overcome these drawbacks due to its heightened visual perception preventing the tunnel vision from occurring and its predictive capabilities making it easier for the user to avoid counterattacks.

Prerequisite 
 Must know Tree Binding Death, Invisibility, 100 Genjutsu score
 
Cost:
 
30chp
 
Description:
 
A typical technique amongst the members of the Kurama clan. The illusion shows the user disappear before the opponent is surrounded by several bean vines that bind their body and lift them into the air. A bean pod then rises from the ground which opens to reveal the user, ready to strike.

As this technique is cast upon a target within ROP range Several bean vines then wrap around the target rendering them grappled for an amount of rounds equal to the castor's Will + Genjutsu vs the target's will. A unique aspect of this technique in comparison to it's parent jutsu is the aspect that two targets can be effected by this jutsu, however the castor must instead grapple their will + Genjutsu vs the two target's will + will ÷ 2

With every 15chp the jutsu allows for one more person to be added into the fray, allowing for a total of 11 targets at tier ten. However as a result with each added person their wills must be added together and divided by the amount affected.

[Bc]Description:
[C]In essense, this is an advanced version of the Finger Carving Seal, however,  instead of meticulously carving seals, your chakra control is so fine, your caligraphy so fine and practiced, that you can mentally shape the characters with your own chakra through you open palm, able to swiftly imprint the formula of your technique by burning your chakra into the point of contact!

[C]Seals made in this way will remain even after the castor dies, even if visable markings are removed, as long as the chakra remains or the target area remains intact. This technique may only imprint up to 20oz, (25 ChP), worth of marking per use.

[Bc]Cost:
[C]7oz Ink, 1 Empty Tag, 7ChP/Meter Distance, 7ChP/Round
[Bc]Description:
[C]Paralysis Tags (麻痺札, Mahi Fuda), also called Petrify Paper, are scraps of paper inscribed with a special Fuinjutsu text. Infused with chakra, they will completely stun whomever attached to after a set amount of time, or remotely remotely. The tags can be attached to a surface or wrapped around a weapon to be thrown at an enemy. They are very versatile and one of the basic ninja tools. They work even under heavy rain. When an paralysis tag is triggered remotely, ninja need to use a hand seal, requiring two hands.

[C]The paralysis has a grapple score of 30 to resist with one's raw Strength, or lasts for 1 minute (60 seconds/10 rounds), or until removed/destroyed. The effect, and chakra cost, is increased by adding more tags, but each tag after the first is only half as effective, adding +1 Stun, but half as strong, and costs half as much chakra. One who knows this technique may also spend 4oz of ink to disable another's petrifying paper and use it as their own.

[Bc]Description:
[C]Hohō or Agility (歩法, hohō; lit. step method) is an ancient technique said to have been developed by a sage long ago amidst fighting a god of death while observing how the Shinigami seemed to be walking on solid air, or so the legend goes...

[C]Eventually, the safe had realized it wasn't air, but rather, they had been collecting some sort of energy beneath their feet to stand on, energy that would be invisible to the naked, mortal eye... The sage would use similar methods they knew to walk up trees and walls, or across bodies of water, to collect, mold, and shape the Natural Chakra that existed all around them to form similar, solid, platforms to travel across. Some say they used this technique to escape the Pure Lands, others say they used the Shinigami's own technique to defeat them, and earn there freedom from the afterlife...

[C]By using this technique,  the user is freely able to walk, run, jump, and travel in a three dimensional space in any direction as they please as if ground existed where it does not. Even if the user were to fall from 100 meters, they may instead fall and "land" a mere two meters down by forming these invisible 1×1m square platforms from seemingly no where beneath their hands or feet. The only ones able to see or sense these platforms are those who are also able to harness Nature or Sage Chakra, or, those who possess the Rennigan. If struck directly by any decent amount of force, these platforms completely shatter, providing no pritection or cover of any sort besides harmless debris,  deflections or pressures.

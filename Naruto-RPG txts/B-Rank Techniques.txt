[Bc]Description:
[C]This jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves from their very on shadow. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. The clones stats directly corellate, being the same % of the originals stats as the portion of split Chakra. For example, if 1 shadow clone is created, it will possess 50% of the users current chakra and stats. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous, limiting the castor to no more than 10 clones at any time.

[C]Unlike the basic Clone Technique, shadow clones are physically real. They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation. Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created, but complicated technology won't be duplicated. Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, shadow clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by dōjutsu, presumably, other than the Rinnegan or the Tenseigan. 

[C]Because they have their own chakra, shadow clones can perform other jutsu, including making more shadow clones. Shadow clones usually disperse once they or their castor runs out of their ChP or HP. When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user. Once dispersed, the clone's intel, experiences, and 50% of their remaining chakra points are transferred back to the user. This also means any Jutsu Scores they increase directly adds to the user's once dispersed!

[Bc]Description:
[C]This technique is typically performed by a team for greatest efficiency, however, an individual may perform this technique. If a team of shinobi perform this jutsu together, they stand in a symmetrical formation and then perform this technique, erecting a solid barrier between them that even souls may not pass through... The barrier is made of purple flames, which will instantly engulf those who come into contact with it, thus preventing anyone from entering or leaving the area. Because the barrier relies on all users to maintain, unable to do anything but hold stationary and concentrate on the barrier. Attacking any one of them can bring down the barrier, To prevent this from happening, castors extend secondary barriers around themselves, making breaking out even more difficult.

[C]The shape of this barrier is dependent on the number of users, from one user forming a sphere around themselves, a pair forming a cylindrical barrier, a trio forming a pyramid, all the way up to a max of ten users forming a Decagonal Prism! The size, strength,  and cost of these barriers is dependent an the amount, and will power, of the castors.

[C]The cost is the total DP of the barrier split equally between the castors. The total "Will" of the castor(s) determines the DP of this barrier. Touching this barrier will inflict 1 Tier of Burn (Lit) equal to the number of users, dealling immediate damage of said tier level. Castors may be no farther apart from eachother than their R.O.P. in meters.

[C]The size of an individual sphearical barrier reaches a diameter of meters equal to their Will. The cylindrical barrier's Diameter + Hieght = Total Will. A barrier formed by two agents creates the ony flat shape, raising a wall between the shinobi, the alength + Hieght = Total Will, neither dimension may larger than either of their ROP. The Pyramid and upward through the rest of the prism shapes, formed by multiple castors is meters equal to their total Will that may be split between the shape's side Lengths and Height. No side or hieght may be smaller than half of any of the castor's Will scores, or larger than their ROP.

A special iryojutsu that allows a person to transplant a set of eyes either into their own body or someone elses. This iryojutsu has been used to help people who have lost eyes in their life or transplant powerful dojutsu such as the Sharingan or Byakugan.

In order to perform this surgery iryojutsu the user must have a working pair of eyes from another person then very carefuly remove the eyes from the patient they are working on, once that is completed, they can transplant the other set of eyes and reconnect the tendons and chakra strings together using medical chakra. The user could also perform this surgery on themself with the help of a clone. Once the eye transplant has been completed the patient will be completely blind for 26hours and must wear bandages over their eyes, if this is removed somehow they will suffer heavy damage to their eyesight since the eyes are not fully adjusted to their new host.

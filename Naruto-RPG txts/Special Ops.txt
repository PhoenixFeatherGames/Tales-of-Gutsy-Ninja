[Cbi]The A.N.B U. (暗部), short for Ansatsu Senjutsu Tokushu Butai, are covert operatives of capable ninja that are dispatched directly by their village leader.
[Cbi]Because of the darkness involved in an Anbu's career, one's personality determines their eligibility into the force, leading to exceptionally skilled shinobi whose personalities don't match the organisation to be rejected. These Shinobi are hand picked by their village leader, for their individual capabilities and special skills. Age, background, gender, or previous rank bear no significance in this decision; however, in tradition, shinobi are not selected as Anbu unless they are at least 13 years old, with almost no known exceptions. Once joined, they undergo training including studying of the human body, and begin wearing masks to conceal their identity, leading to them using code names to identify each other.
[Cbi]Anbu nearly always are on site for important missions inside and in the vicinity of their village, though they remain unseen, but are mainly tasked with assassinations or disturbances in foreign countries. The assignments that they conduct to protect the village from exceptional threats include high-risk infiltration into enemy territory, dealing with extremely strong ninja, tracking, surveillance, interrogating enemy ninja to learn information and missions requiring specially trained ninja. Due to the actions of the group, one can appear changed and corrupted of kindness. Due to the often sensitive nature of their missions and the unique abilities they sometimes possess, Anbu are expected to destroy their bodies if they are too badly injured on a mission so that they can't be captured, as well as the bodies of their targets, storing just the heads if needed. Anbu dislike letting anyone know their identities, as damages caused by their leaked identities could cost them their position, or even their own head, and as such, most citizens aren't aware of who is and isn't an Anbu.
[Cbi]Any and all orders they receive come from their Kage and no one else. This limits them from taking any posted Missions, and instead are paid by salary, not by commission, recieving 50,000 ryō ,(and 20EXP), per month, considered as an A-Ranked duty, to discreetly patrol the village and guard its leaders, most prominently, the Kage from the shadows. The exception to this is when the Kage directly instruct them to perform more critical on the field work outside of the village, which may sometimes fall in line with other's missions such as by observation, or occasionally support, or to perform the aforementioned operations in foreign, typically hostile, territory. These assignments may be compensated as B, A, or S Ranked at the discretion of the Kage.
[Bci]The lowest Rank a shinobi may be recruited at would be as a Special Chūnin, (or at 200+ Potential), to which they will recieve their rank of Jonin with their Title of Anbu, and are typically relieved of this service by the time they reach Special Jonin rank, (Or at 500 Potential), so they may retire from this physically and mentally scarring position to take up a more managable position in regular operations, or take their full retirement as a civilian.
[Cui]*Once granted the Title of Anbu, the shinobi recieves the uniform;
• Anbu Mask <+15DP, Must be Anbu> | C
• Anbu Armor <+25DP, Must be Anbu> | B-
• Ninjatō <Sharp, +8Dmg, +10DP> | B-

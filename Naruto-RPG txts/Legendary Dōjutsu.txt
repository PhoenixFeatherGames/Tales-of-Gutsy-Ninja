[Bsc]Description:
[Cs]The Rinnegan, literally meaning:Saṃsāra Eye, is reputed as the most exalted eye amongst the "Three Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Sharingan and the Byakugan. It is said that in times of disorder, one who wields the Rinnegan is sent down from the heavens to become either a "God of Creation" who will calm the world or a "God of Destruction" who will reduce everything to nothingness. Even though known by most as nothing more than myth, it's existence is kept purely secretive and forbidden out of fear of it's theorised power and danger to the world. 

[Cs]To awaken the Rinnegan naturally, assuming the prerequisites are met, one must have the Mangekyō Sharingan or the EMS and undergo the same level of trauma of higher. If evolved from MS, that pair of eyes can never become EMS, however,  the user may no longer go blind from MS use, or if they already had, awakening the Rennegan is the only cure for sharingan blindness from over use. Even though it evolves from the Sharingan, it gains it's own Jutsu Skill slot the user progresses from it's usage. Although naturally evolved Rinnegan may use the abilities of Mangekyō before this stage, if transplanted, it's new host may not change it's state nor use (E)MS abilities it's true master could, and like any other occular transplant, it may not devolve to a lesser form then when transplanted to it's new host. (E)MS abilities cannot be used when Rinnegan is active, meaning one must shift their eye(s) to (E)MS to use said abilities with said eye(s), just how one must have Rinnegan active to use it's abilities.

[Cs]By default, the Rinnegan gives the user unparalleled visual prowess, visably see chakra and it's pathways in the body, as well as spiritual or ethereal entities, through all obstructions and track year old chakra tracks. The user may replicate techniques, if physically capable, after witnessing them performed a single time, being proficient in all nature transformations, and passively increase their EP, OP, and ROP by +66%. Perhaps most dangerous of all, these eyes can freely take full control of Bijū and imperfect Jinchūriki. 

[Cs]Just as the Sharingan have the "Eye of Insight" and the "Eye of Hypnotism", The Rinnegan's left eye is the "Hellish Eye" and the right eye is the "Heavenly Eye". The left eye draws it's powers from the hellish realms of Naraka, Preta, and Animal. The Right eye draws it's powers from the heavenly realms of Human, Asura, and Deva. These divine powers known as the "6 Paths" are realised as one grows the power of the Rennigan, but the very last path awakened draws from outside of these realms, needing the power of both eyes, the 7th path, the Outer Path...

[Cs]The Six Paths Technique (六道の術, Rikudō no Jutsu) is the origin of the unique techniques bestowed by the Rinnegan. Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques under a single S-Rank slot in the host's Jutsu Bank, though only wielding both eyes will yield their true power. Despite it's name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities;

[Bsc]Rank:
[cs]S-Rank, KKG, Kinjutsu, Passive
[Bcs]Technique:
[cs]Doujutsu
[Bsc]Element:
[Cs]Yin-Yang
[BsC]Prerequisite 
[Cs]Byakugan must be transplanted from a Hyuuga of one beanch to another, or from/to an Ōtsutsuki, or transplanted from another host. This may also be awoken through the perfect fusion of Sōke and Bunke DNA, only known to naturally form in an Ōtsutsuki once through Hamura.
[Bsc]Cost:
[Cs]16ChP / Round activated per eye activated, Double if transplanted
[Bsc]Description:
[Cs]The Tenseigan (転生眼, literally meaning: Reincarnation Eye) is a dōjutsu that can be acquired when the divided chakra of Hamura Ōtsutsuki is united into one body. The chakra of Hamura has been split into the two Hyuuga branches, but as kin or ancestors of Hamura, Ōtsutsuki may also awaken his Tenseigan by taking the eyes of his Hyuuga descendants. Likewise, Hyuuga may awaken the Tenseigan, in some cases, by taking the Byakugan of Ōtsutsuki, or of their counter family branch. Even though known by most as nothing more than myth, it's existence is kept purely secretive and forbidden out of fear of it's theorised power and danger to the world. 

[Cs]Once awoken, the Tenseigan replaces the host's Byakugan. They gain a "Tenseigan" jutsu score that adds their previous Byakugan score to it's use. The active Tenseigan has perfect  360° vision, and it's visual prowess is twice that of it's previous state as a Byakugan. These eyes give the user unparalleled visual prowess, able to visably see chakra and it's pathways in the body, as well as spiritual or ethereal entities, through all obstructions and track year old chakra tracks.

[Cs]Aside from enhanced visual ability, these eyes offer powers comparable to legends of the freat Sage of 6 Paths! Similar to the "Rennegan", the Tenseigan grants the user proficiency in all nature transformations, including Yin-Yang release, and just like the Rinnegan, all abilities granted by these eyes share a single S-Rank slot in the Jutsu Bank:
[S]○●[|] Sekiryoku Tensei [|]
[S]○●[|] Inryoku Tensei [|]
[S]○●[|] Tenseigan Chakra Mode [|]
[S]○●[|] Golden Wheel Reincarnation Explosion [|]
[S]○●[|] Silver Wheel Reincarnation Explosion [|]
[S]○●[|] Localised Reincarnation Explosion [|]

[Cs]To summarize, on top of the aforementioned enhanced abilities, the Tenseigan may manipulate gravity in a manner Sima to the "Rinnegan's" Deva Path but in a finer way, able force any two bodies of matter the user may sense, A and B, to or from eachother. However,  to truly tap the godly potential of these eyes, one must activate the Tenseigan Chakra Mode, (TCM). This state may only be used for 1 minute per day, as long as the Tenseigan is active, before locking access to ones own chakra for 26 hours, but while in this state, the user's power is increased three fold and granted six truth seeking orbs along with the full ability of flight! The power of these near indestructible orbs made of every chakra nature then open the doors through which the host may bring utter destruction...
